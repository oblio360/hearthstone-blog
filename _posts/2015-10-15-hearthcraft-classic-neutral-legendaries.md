Hello, I'm *oblio* and I'll be your host for a new series called "Which cards should I craft first as a new
Hearthstone player?". That's a mouth-full, so I'll just call it "HearthCraft" from now on :smile:

One of the most important things you have to decide as a new player is: which cards you're going to craft with your
spare dust.  Unless your name is Donald Trump, you probably don't want to throw a lot of
:heavy_dollar_sign::heavy_dollar_sign::heavy_dollar_sign: on cards you will not use.

<p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid darkgrey; color: darkred;">This guide is meant for players who want a
collection that allows them to play the highest variety of competitive decks. If you love to play the same class or
archetype over and over and over again, your crafting priority will be different.
<br> 
This guide is also meant as a long term guide. This means that some cards have been selected because they are close to
being viable now and it's not hard to predict that they will become usable once Hearthstone's card pool becomes
bigger.</p>

Hearthstone has a lot of cards so I've decided to make several articles about this topic, each one of them covering a
different part of the ever-growing Hearthstone collection. As new expansions appear I will publish new articles and I
will link them here, so stay tuned!

Let's get started. I'll list the cards according to their crafting priority.


# Must have

These are the cards that are most likely to be used in decks you create or you find on the internet. They are so
powerful or versatile that most players would consider them better than the alternatives.

## Sylvannas Windrunner

<img alt="Sylvannas Windrunner" src="/images/common/sylvannas-windrunner.png" style="float: right;">

Sylvannas is a staple of many control and midrange decks. Besides the solid 5/5 body she comes with a game-swinging
deathrattle: she steals an enemy minion. As a 5/5 she can deal with most aggro deck minions (which are usually high
attack - low HP minions) or she can suicide into the control deck's "bomb" and steal the damage unit after she dies.
Either way, decent against aggro and a huge swing against midrange and control decks. She tends to provoke awkward
trades or overextension by board flooding (thus playing directly into AOE).

Sylvannas can be seen in a large number of decks and she has "survived" 2 expansions and 2 adventures already. Unless
major [power creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_creep) occurs, she will still be seen in many decks in the
future.

*I have no time for games. (Really?)*

## Ysera

<img alt="Ysera" src="/images/common/ysera.png" style="float:right;">

Ysera is the veteran "control dragon". She has a solid 4/12 body which is quite hard to kill unless you have direct
removal when she is played. If not answered she starts creating special cards called ["Dream
Cards"](http://hearthstone.wikia.com/wiki/Dream_Card#Dream_Cards). These cards range from decent (3 mana untargetable
3/5, 4 mana dragon 7/6) to strong (0 mana return minion to owner's hand, 0 mana give minion 5/5 then destroy it next
turn) to almost overpowered (2 mana deal 5 damage to all characters except Ysera).

Against aggro decks and midrange decks the body can trade at least 2-to-1, while the dream cards can at minimum provide
additional bodies to throw on the table and at best can provide additional reach for a surprise lethal while racing.
Aggro decks are less affected by Ysera as by turn 9, when she is usually played, they are close to killing the enemy and
Ysera doesn't have an immediate effect on the board or on either player's HP.

Besides the advantages mentioned against aggro and midrange decks, against control decks the body usually trades at
least 1-to-1 while the dream cards provide another stream of cards allowing the Ysera player to avoid drawing and going
into fatigue first.

Overall, a very solid card in slower metas and a staple of the dragon "tribe".

*I dream and the world trembles. (She's right!)*

## Alexstrasza

<img alt="Alexstrasza" src="/images/common/alexstrasza.png" style="float:right;">

Alexstrasza is another veteran from the dragon "tribe". She can be seen in control and combo decks. Depending on the
situation Alexstrasza is either used to do up to 15 damage to the enemy's face (maybe allowing lethal next turn) or to
heal for up to 15 damage. On top of the instant effect she brings a 8/8 body which trades well with most enemy minions
or forces the usage of direct removal. Even if the enemy uses removal on the body, the effect has already taken place,
and it is a very powerful effect in many circumstances.

Especially for new players Alexstrasza provides one of the best examples of "good card": instant, powerful effect on the
game.

*I bring life and hope. (50% of the time.)*

## Ragnaros the Firelord

<img alt="Ragnaros the Firelord" src="/images/common/ragnaros-the-firelord.png" style="float:right;">

Ragnaros is staple of midrange or control decks. He is a weird minion, more like a turret than an actual minion, since he
cannot attack directly. Instead, at the end of the round he does 8 damage to a random enemy target. You can think of him
as a [Demolisher](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Demolisher) on steroids.

Ragnaros is the epitome of big threat: 8 mana for 8/8 stats, does 8 damage to a random enemy. In most situations he
cannot be ignored so he is used as a sort of "timer".

Against aggro decks he is only used to race while against midrange and control decks he is usually used for a 50-50
chance of destroying a huge enemy threat or to bring the enemy into lethal range.

*Die, insect! (Can't argue with that.)*

## Harrison Jones

<img alt="Harrison Jones" src="/images/common/harrison-jones.png" style="float:right;">

Harrison Jones is a bit of an odd-ball on the "must have" list. He's not the staple of any deck. With his 5/4 stats and
his quirky battlecry, he can't really be. He is however one of the most common "tech cards". Any time classes with
weapons flood the metagame, Harrison is bound to show up. Together with his smaller brother, [Acidic Swamp
Ooze](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Acidic_Swamp_Ooze). Or, for the more desperate amongst us, [Bloodsail
Corsair](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Bloodsail_Corsair).

There are 4 classes which can have weapons:

* Warrior
* Hunter
* Paladin
* Shaman

It's a good bet that any time in Hearthstone's history at least one of those classes was popular of very popular. As a
result, Harrison is a common sight in decks. Even if he's not "must have" in the sense that you can't build your deck
without him, you will want to have him in those moments of need.

Against aggro and midrange decks Harrison is used either as a vanilla 5 mana 5/4 (quite underwhelming) or as a weapon
removal in a crucial moment in the game (for example against a Hunter with a [Eaglehorn
Bow](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Eaglehorn_Bow) and a trap in play). If the midrange deck is slower he might even
be used for the second part of his battlecry, card drawing.

Against control Harrison is used in the same way, but with less emphasis on playing him without benefiting from his
battlecry, and a lot more emphasis on drawing several cards when possible.

*That belongs in a museum. (Nooooo... my Doomhammer!)*

# Nice to have

These are cards which are not seen as often in powerful decks as the "must haves". Nonetheless, they are strong cards
and depending on personal preference they can crafted sooner and you will not regret your decision.

## Bloodmage Thalnos

<img alt="Bloodmage Thalnos" src="/images/common/bloodmage-thalnos.png" style="float:right;">

Bloodmage Thalnos is a pint sized legendary. A minuscule body with 2 strong effects attached: draw a card and spell
damage +1.

From the beginning of Hearthstone Thalnos has been a friend of Rogues, Shamans and Mages, helping them with their card
draw problems and with removal.

Unlike most of the cards on these lists, Thalnos is not flashy. The minuscule skeleton come on the board when it's time
to kill the enemy, destroy a minion or there's a dire need for another card.

One could say that he's the [redshirt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_%28character%29) of Hearthstone.

*We hngngngnr for vengeance. (Is he a Murloc skeleton by any chance? What's with the "hngngngr"?)*

## Malygos

<img alt="Malygos" src="/images/common/malygos.png" style="float:right;">

Also known as "the creator of many OTK videos". Malygos packs a powerful body, the same as Ysera's (4/12) but with a
different kind of effect. Malygos' effect is instant and is very strong (+5 spell damage) but in many situations cannot
be used because Malygos himself costs 9 mana. And once Malygos is on the board the enemy will do whatever it takes to
kill him.

As a result Malygos is a bit less consistent than Ysera. Still, players have found ways to include him in top-tier decks
and even if you're not that competitive, he's the kind of Minion that can really make for [interesting
videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkOYGkQ3iMU).

*I am the essence of magic!.*

## Leeroy Jenkins

<img alt="Leeroy Jenkins" src="/images/common/leeroy-jenkins.png" style="float:right;">

"Leeeeeeeroy Jenkins" is the sound many Hearthstone players have heard just before they lost the game. Leeroy is a 5
mana 6 damage charger many decks have used in the past as a finisher. Combo Warlock, Face Hunter and especially Miracle
Rogue have used him successfully. And every time there's a new aggro deck that needs a way to push for a bit more
damage, Leeroy pops up from time to time. Leeroy is not in the "must have" list since he has been nerfed from 4 mana to 5
mana.

He is still a solid card if you're more into aggro/face decks.

*Leeeeeeeerroooooooy Jeeeeenki.... (Oh, shut up already!)*

## The Black Knight

<img alt="The Black Knight" src="/images/common/the-black-knight.png" style="float:right;">

From the Harrison Jones of tech cards comes The Black Knight (also known as TBK). TBK has a very specific niche and he's
very good at it: destroying taunts. For 6 mana he comes with a modest 4/5 body and a powerful effect in the right
conditions: destroy an enemy with taunt.

His effect is strong but he is a lot more situational than Harrison (and also 1 mana more expensive, another important
factor) and as a result he is not in the list of "must haves". However, when Ramp Druids, Handlocks or other classes
with an emphasis on taunts pop up en-masse, TBK is the go-to-minion (together with his little brother, [Ironbeak
Owl](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Ironbeak_Owl)).

*None shall pass! (I'm a little confused here, but ok)*

## Deathwing

<img alt="Deathwing" src="/images/common/deathwing.png" style="float:right;">

The biggest, baddest dragon of them all. 10 mana for a 12/12 that also clear the board, entirely. But he also discards
your whole hand.

Deathwing is the epitome of face smashing. You will see him in strange aggro decks that want a flashy finisher or in
control decks built around dragons.

He is also extremely, extremely slow against aggro decks, since you can usually only play him on turn 10 (you might
already be dead by turn 7...).

A wonderfully designed card. It's a pity that he lives in a world with [Big Game
Hunters](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Big_Game_Hunter) (BGH),
[Annoy-o-trons](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Annoy-o-Tron) and [Sludge
Belchers](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Sludge_Belcher).

*I am power incarnate! (Somehow, [I don't believe
that.](http://kimoss.deviantart.com/art/Deathwing-vs-Annoy-o-tron-513659829))*


## Cairne Bloodhoof

<img alt="Cairne Bloodhoof" src="/images/common/cairne-bloodhoof.png" style="float:right;">

Cairne is the epitome of value. For 6 mana you're getting 8/10 worth of stats distributed in 2 rather solid bodies. He
was once a staple of control decks.

Unfortunately, right now a 4-attack value isn't strong enough since it doesn't trade well into the usual 5/5s played on
turn 5 or 6. And it also can't one-shot the first half of Sludge Belcher.

However, Cairne still packs a lot of stats together with a useful and consistent deathrattle. It's hard to discount the
old Tauren forever.

*Take heart, young one. The Earth Mother is near. (I :heart: taurens!)*

## Baron Geddon

<img alt="Baron Geddon" src="/images/common/baron-geddon.png" style="float:right;">

Baron Geddon is seen most often in control Warrior decks. Sometimes he even shows up in other grindy control decks, such
as Control Mage.

He brings a decent 7/5 body and a very powerful effect that can backfire: 2 damage done to every character, at the end
of every round. His effect is great against board blooding. If he is not killed he almost guarantees a clear board every
time.

Unfortunately for him, there aren't many classes in Hearthstone that can take the self-punishment of 2 damage to every
friendly minion plus 2 damage to your own hero, on top of that.

*You... will buuurn! (For at least 1 round!)*

## King Mukla

<img alt="King Mukla" src="/images/common/king-mukla.png" style="float:right;">

An unlikely contender for the list, I admit, Mukla can fit some very interesting niches. He's been used successfully as
part of Face Hunter decks (Mukla is a beast, literally) and Aggro Paladin ([Divine
Favor](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Divine_Favor) can draw more cards of off the
bananas you give your opponent).

Mukla is the epitome of tempo: you get a 5/5 beast on round 3. He can trade at least 2-to-1 or can usually get in at
least 5 face damage. The bananas he gives your opponent can backfire and that's why he's not higher on the list. But in
the right deck your enemies won't have a lot of time to digest their bananas...

*Raaaawwwrr! (I think!)*

## Captain Greenskin

<img alt="Captain Greenskin" src="/images/common/captain-greenskin.png" style="float:right;">

The last neutral legendary in the Classic set to make the cut for the list is Captain Greenskin. As a 5/5 body for 5
mana, he is underwhelming, but he comes with a decent battlecry and is part of the "pirate" tribe.

If there's ever a chance for the pirates to become popular, you can bet that Captain Greenskin will be part of them.
Every now and then a Pirate deck appears, usually Pirate Rogue, and every time Captain Greenskin is the leader of the
expedition.

*Drink up, me hearties!*

# Forgotten & crazy legendaries

Besides the legendaries we've already reviewed, some legendaries have either faded into the past or only wacky decks
play them. Here they are:

Legendary name | Why is is not played?
-------------- | --------------------
Onyxia         | Too slow. She does seem interesting, though.
Nozdormu       | Too slow, dies to BGH, too freaky.
Gruul          | Too slow, dies to BGH.
Hogger         | Body too small, doesn't trade well.
Illidan Stormrage | Dies to BGH, it's hard to trigger him many times.
The Beast      | Dies to BGH and then helps your opponent.
Tinkmaster Overspark | Too risky. It's too easy to give your opponent a 5/5 or turn your own big minion into a 1/1.
Lorewalker Cho | No deck can afford to play 0 spells.
Millhouse Manastorm | No deck can afford to let the opponent play **all** his spells in 1 turn, for free.
Nat Pagle      | Too slow, too risky, doesn't trade at all.

And here we have it, folks. Stay tuned for the next episodes!
