Welcome to Hearthstone, you suck!

Everyone who has ever tried to play Dota or Dota 2 (or basically any competitive multiplayer game) has probably been
greeted by a similar "greeting". For some reason many human beings like to improve their self esteem by putting other
people down.

Luckily for us Hearthstone doesn't have in-game chat so even if your opponent doesn't like you, at worst you'll be
facing passive-aggressive emotes... ahem... *["I greet you"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf9kbLYh-y8)*.

Some people will try to get past the emotes to tell you that you [really](http://imgur.com/a/5hLGc),
[really](http://imgur.com/a/PSMur) suck. But we don't care about those people. And we hope they get professional
treatment.

Anyway, getting back on track, you might be wondering what this article is about. It is a guide to Hearthstone for newer
players. It covers all major aspects of Hearthstone and links to some of the best resources available for any particular
topic. I will update this article as new Hearthstone expansions appear but most of it should be as relevant in the
future as it is now.

If you have suggestion for improvements use the comment section below or just contact me (contact details on the [about
page](http://hearthstone.oblio360.com/about)).

#<a name="required-reading">Required reading</a>


Before we start talking about Hearthstone there are some articles I consider interesting and which I think you should
read before going further, the main reason is that this way we'll make sure that we are on the same page and talking
about the same things.

##<a name="player-types">Timmy, Johnny and Spike</a>

Hearthstone has been inspired by a card game called [Magic the
Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) (MTG for short).
The creators of MTG, Wizards of the Coast, regularly publish articles about the design of MTG.
["Timmy, Johnny and Spike"](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr11b) is one of the
most important articles they've published, where they describe a very important design principle for MTG: player
profiles they've created and which they use when designing new cards.

**TL;DR:**

* Timmy: big creatures good!
* Johnny: my 7-card combo did 80 damage!
* Spike: Winning = everything!
* A player is a mix of Timmy-Johnny-Spike, and usually 1 side dominates (Timmy 60% + Spike 40%, 20% Timmy + 80% Johnny).

For you as a player it's important to figure out what your main focus will be because depending on it you will have to
make various decisions as how to invest your time and money (Hearthstone can be a really expensive hobby if you're not
careful).

##<a name="play-to-win">Playing to win</a>

["Playing to win"](http://www.sirlin.net/articles/playing-to-win) is a really old article by Sirlin which applies to
basically any competitive multiplayer game. His examples come from fighting games such as StreetFighter but the ideas
are valid in any game where people compete.

**TL;DR:**

* Figure out if you're playing for fun or to win.
* If you're playing for fun don't feel bad if you lose.
* If you feel bad when you lose then you're really playing to win, you just don't want to accept it.
* When you decide that you play to win, use the best tactic allowed by the rules of the game.
* Don't allow yourself to get blocked by fake "moral" arguments while playing to win.
* Also when you play to win, always look for reasons why you lost within your own actions, not outside.

To which I'd add:

* Don't burn out. Unless you're a paid professional, take a break from the grind from time to time.

Trump is one of the best known professional Hearthstone players, also one of the most popular Hearthstone streamers. He
has published a series of videos where he teaches the basics of Hearthstone. Highly recommended as a newbie to
Hearthstone and minion-based card games in general.

You can find the playlist here: [Trump Teachings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvEIxIeBRKSjprrvlbAcbVjzHsnH9PjDX).

#<a name="game-metagame">The game and the meta-game</a>

When discussing or reading about Hearthstone you'll often hear about something called "the metagame".  Basically
Hearthstone is a game of cards, as we know. Each time you click "Play" and you're looking for an opponent you're going
to play the actual game, the one where you draw minions and spells, play them and try to kill the enemy hero before he
kills you.

But as you get to know more and more about Hearthstone you'll notice that there is a sort of game outside of the actual
game.  the so-called "metagame" ("game about the game").  Players are competing to not only out-play each other during
the actual games, but even before the game starts.

How do you outplay an opponent you haven't even met before Blizzard's match making system pairs you up with him?  By
selecting the best deck to fight whatever is thrown against you.

There are 3 major parts to the metagame:

* deck creation

* deck selection

* deck tweaking

##<a name="deck-creation">Deck creation</a>

I'm going to start with this one, even though it is by far the hardest part of Hearthstone.  You've opened Hearthstone,
clicked "My Collection" -> "New Deck" and now are looking at a blank list which you will need to fill with 30 cards.
You're like a writer looking at a blank page.

Depending on your personality, this case be either a scary moment or a fun one. 

If this is a scary moment, I recommend that you skip to the [deck selection](#deck-selection) part.

If on the other hand this is a fun moment, go ahead! Start adding cards and play. Just remember that the initial plan
you had for the deck might not work out so don't feel bad if you lose to people playing decks which have been
combat-tested across thousands of games.  All that matters is that you have fun. Either by winning a lot of games, or
some games in a spectacular fashion or by tweaking your deck until it often does what you want it to do.

One thing to always keep in mind: creating entirely new decks is hard. Hearthstone has millions and millions of players
all trying to outsmart each other constantly and some of them have created highly efficient, ruthless, hero-killing
machine-type decks. You will meet all of them as you play more and more games.

[This article](http://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/how-to-build-a-deck-in-hearthstone) has some good advice about
making a deck.

Ok, the next best option to creating your own deck is using a pre-existing deck. The disadvantage is that you'll be playing a
deck that other players are also playing and as a result your opponents will have probably faced this deck at least
once. In case of really popular decks, they've probably seen it many times (Hi there, "Face Hunter"!).

#<a name="basic decks">Basic decks</a>

Courtesy of Sheng from [hearthstonecoaching.gom](http://www.hearthstonecoaching.com/), a set of [good basic
decks](http://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/2fgq0x/basic_deck_guides_for_all_9_classes_0_dust/).

These deck won't take you to legend (unless you're super smart or super lucky or both :smile: ), but they are a good
place to start.  Each deck comes with an explanation of why a specific card was selected over another one and the
reasoning is solid.

Especially at the beginning I recommend that you play a bit with these decks while you level up your classes and try to
get a feel for each class until at some point you will probably arrive at a playstyle you like or a class you like. Or
both.

But before that I have 1 major recommendation: do not disenchant any card unless you have 3x (for non-legend cards) or
2x (for legend cards).

#<a name="budget decks">Budget decks</a>

Now we're getting to the more volatile sections. These decks were made during the period after the Blackrock Mountain
adventure (BRM for short) and before the Grand Tournament (TGT for short) release.
 
It is very important to note that unlike the basic decks, which are completely free, these require more resources. And
this is where "budget" becomes very important.

Hearthstone has been designed to be "free to play" (F2P). This means that it can be played for free. But actually making
such a complex game and hosting it for millions of players for many years is not cheap. As a result not everything in
Hearthstone is available immediately. The major thing players care about are cards. Out of the total number of cards,
hundreds and hundreds, only a small number are available for free.

The rest have to be paid, with either your cash or your time. In Hearthstone time = gold.

Based on the amount of cash and time you have you could either spend hundreds of dollars on the game to get a full
collection ($1000 should do the trick) or spend hundreds and hundreds of hours (it could be even thousands of hours).
 
Of course, you don't need a full collection to play, but to really enjoy the experience you will probably need at least
1-2 somewhat competitive decks per class.

And if you are here, then you probably want to improve, so you are competitive, you are "Spike".

**StrifeCro**

* Deck preference: control & combo.
* Presentation & playstyle: serious & fast.
* Game modes: constructed.

**Trump**

* Deck preference: control.
* Presentation & playstyle: serious & slow.
* Game modes: constructed, arena, brawl.

Trump is one of the best known professional Hearthstone players and one of the most popular Hearthstone streamers. He is
a very good player but his presentation can be a little dry for some and he is also known as a slow player. So I'd
recommend patience while watching him.
Another thing to note is that Trump leans towards "value" (i.e. only playing cards when he can get the biggest benefit
out of playing him) so he tends to play control decks and isn't as strong while playing fast or combo decks.
Still, a solid streamer and his Youtube videos have good editing, I'd recommend that you watch only the videos if you
don't have a lot of time on your hands.
