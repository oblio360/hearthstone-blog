At the end of the [HearthCraft Basics](http://hearthstone.oblio360.com/2015/10/26/hearthcraft-basics/) article I
mentioned that there are some key cards which should be crafted first, and I promised I'd write a separate article about
those "key cards". Well, here is that article :smile:

I will go through all the cards in Hearthstone and I will list the best cards for each category. The categories being:

### <a name="druid">Druid</a>

<img alt="Keeper of the Grove" src="/images/common/keeper-of-the-grove.png" style="float: right;">

#### Keeper of the Grove

Good, old, trustworthy Keeper of the Grove. As a new player the 4 mana 2/4 minion doesn't seem much (the standard for a
4 mana minion is 4/5). But the effect makes up for the fact that the stats on the actual minion are low.

Keeper of the Grove can either do 2 damage to an enemy or silence an enemy. This provides any deck which includes it a
lot of flexibility as the Keeper can take out a small threat, such as a <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/422-knife-juggler">Knife Juggler</a>, finish off a damaged larger enemy or silence
a minion with a very dangerous effect (such as <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/33-sylvanas-windrunner">Sylvanas
Windrunner</a>). In case of emergencies it can even do 2 face damage to finish off an enemy.

The effect provided by him is very powerful and the body, even though understatted, is still good. It especially good at
fighting off small minions, such as those in aggro decks. Keeper of the Grove can even 3 for 1 aggro minions (1 with its
effect, 2 with its body).

One of the most reliable Druid cards, seen in aggro, midrange and control Druid decks.

* * *

<img alt="Darnassus Aspirant" src="/images/common/darnassus-aspirant.png" style="float: right;">

#### Darnassus Aspirant

One of the latest entries (it was introduced in [The Grant
Tournament](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/The_Grand_Tournament)), Darnassus Aspirant is a 2 mana 2/3 minion which
comes with 2 effects: its battlecry increases your total mana by 1 and its deathrattle decreases it by 1.

If not killed on time Darnassus Aspirant allows the Druid to play cards which cost more mana ahead of time (this is
called "ramping"). Very dangerous, since the Druid has access to very powerful big cards such as <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/605-cenarius">Cenarius</a> or to a very strong and famous combo: <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/237-force-of-nature">Force of Nature</a> / <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/329-savage-roar">Savage Roar</a>.

Also, in a similar way to the Keeper of the Grove, its body is also a defensive one: 2/3 instead of 3/2. This means that
the Aspirant can also trade favorably with smaller minions. The 3 health also makes it harder to kill under some
circumstances, therefore allowing it to survive longer so that the player can take advantage of its battlecry.

The Aspirant is also seen in many types of decks ranging from aggro to control.

* * *

<img alt="Druid of the Claw" src="/images/common/druid-of-the-claw.png" style="float: right;">

#### Druid of the Claw

Another staple of Druid decks, Druid of the Claw is the best known "transformer" in the game. When played for 5 mana,
Druid of the Claw can either become a Bear (4/6 with Taunt) or a Cat (/4/4 with Charge).

Both forms are strong, although there is a slight preference for the Bear. The Cat form is usually chosen when an enemy
minion really needs to be destroyed this turn and there's no alternative way to do it or the enemy can be killed this
round.

Druid of the Claw is so solid and versatile that he can be seen in all types of Druid decks. The Cat is greatly
appreciated in aggro decks while the Bear is welcome in midrange or control Druid decks.

* * *

<img alt="Force of Nature" src="/images/common/force-of-nature.png" style="float: right;">

### Force of Nature

One of the best known spells in the game. Not on its own. But as part of the most famous Hearthstone combo: Force of
Nature / <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/329-savage-roar">Savage Roar</a>. On its own Force of Nature is not
something to write home about, for 6 mana it provides just 6 damage. <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/522-fireball">Fireball</a> provides the same amount of damage for 6 mana. Force of
Nature shines because it is a versatile spell (the core characteristic of all Druid cards). It can do 6 damage to the
enemy's face or to his minions. Since it spawns 3 minions with charge, each of them can be used independently to focus
another target, for example for clearing the opponent's board.

But its highlight is when it is paired with Savage Roar. For 9 mana this combo does a total of 14 damage (2 from the
hero itself and 4 from each treant). As a result every Druid opponent has to make sure that he has a taunt up when his
life total is below 15 HP.

* * *

<img alt="Wrath" src="/images/common/wrath.png" style="float: right;">

#### Wrath

Wrath is a 2 mana cost spell that is used for removing a small but very threatening minion, finishing off a larger
minion or drawing a card (when it only does 1 damage).

This flexibility comes at a cost as Wrath can only target minions, but the flexibility greatly surpasses this downside
and as a result Wrath is seen in almost all Druid decks.

It is frequently used to fend off very aggressive decks or to draw 1 more card when the Druid player is out of fuel
(usually when he is the one playing the beatdown deck).

Used in all but the most aggressive of Druid decks.


* * *

<img alt="Ancient of Lore" src="/images/common/ancient-of-lore.png" style="float: right;">

#### Ancient of Lore

The venerable tre(e)ant is another example of a very versatile card. For 7 mana you get a 5/5 body that can either heal
you for 5 or draw 2 cards.

The 5/5 body is a little under the standard for a 5 mana minion while its effect costs either a little under 2 mana (<a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/108-holy-light">Holy Light</a>) or a little under 3 mana (<a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/489-arcane-intellect">Arcane Intellect</a>). The whole package definitely deserves
paying 7 mana for.

In general the effect is used to draw cards, especially when "fishing" for the parts of the Force of Nature / Savage
Roar combo. But against aggro decks it can also be used to heal yourself and gain a bit more time to stabilize on board
and eventually win the game.

Ancient of Lore is seen in all but the most aggressive of Druid decks and is one of the core cards of the decks he's
part of.

* * *

<img alt="Living Roots" src="/images/common/living-roots.png" style="float: right;">

#### Living Roots

Living Roots is another new entry in the Druid arsenal. It was introduced in TGT, together with Darnassus Aspirant, and
it was widely adopted by the community.

Its uses are multiple: fend off aggressive decks through the Saplings or the nuke, damage the enemy's face (probably
just before winning the game), provide more "boots on the ground" to be used next round for Savage Roar.

Some of the fastest wins in the game have involved Living Roots (2x Living Roots provide 4 minions, and when Savage Roar
is used these 4 minions total 12 damage, 2x Savage Roar and the damage goes up to 20 damage; add the 2 / 4 damage that
the hero gets from Savage Roar and a quick win is possible).

## Hunter

<img alt="Unleash the Hounds" src="/images/common/unleash-the-hounds.png" style="float: right;">

#### Unleash the Hounds

Probably one of the most hated Hunter cards. For 3 mana you get one 1/1 hound with charge for each enemy minions. As a
result Unleash the Hounds punishes decks that flood the board with small minions. This, on its own, would be a decent
effect. But in combination with <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/422-knife-juggler">Knife Juggler</a> the effect
is even stronger as for each dog with charge there's also a random ping (1 damage hit) on enemy minions.

To add insult to injury, the hounds are beasts. Which means that enable the supercharged, 5-damage version of <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/488-kill-command">Kill Command</a>. A full Knife Juggler - Unleash the Hounds -
Kill Command combo can do up to 17 face damage against a full enemy board and if all the knives hit the enemy's face.

Unleash the Hounds is played in Face Hunter decks (extremely aggressive Hunter decks which mostly hit the enemy's face)
as well as in slower Hunter decks. Its role varies from burst face damage to board control of even a combination of
both.

* * *

<img alt="Eaglehorn Bow" src="/images/common/eaglehorn-bow.png" style="float: right;">

#### Eaglehorn Bow

The signature Hunter weapon. For 3 mana you get a 3 attack / 2 durability weapon that gets another charge when a friendly secret is
revealed.

This might not sounds like much since <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/632-fiery-war-axe">Fiery War Axe</a>
(lovingly nicknamed "Fiery Win Axe") costs 2 mana for a 3/2 weapon. But since the Bow gets another charge for each
friendly secret revealed, Eaglehorn Bow can become a 3/3 or even a 3/4 weapon if enough secrets are revealed.

And revealing secrets is easy for most Hunters as <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/7748-mad-scientist">Mad
Scientist</a> is a popular card in Hunter decks.

Eaglehorn bow is used both for face damage (Face Hunters) or board control (Midrange Hunters).

* * *

<img alt="Glaivezooka" src="/images/common/glaivezooka.png" style="float: right;">

#### Glaivezooka

Another fan favorite, Glaivezooka. For 2 mana you get a 2/2 weapon that buffs a random minion on the board, giving it +1
damage.

Initially considered a rather weak weapon (the gold standard for 2 mana weapons being the aforementioned 3/2 Fiery Win
Axe), it's utility was quickly discovered and Glaivezooka started appearing in more and more decks. The early adopters
were Face Hunters but soon Midrange Hunters started using at least 1 copy as well.

Great for trading up (the buffed minion can kill a bigger enemy minion), clearing the board or... going face :smile:

* * *

<img alt="Explosive Trap" src="/images/common/explosive-trap.png" style="float: right;">

#### Explosive Trap

Explosive Trap is probably the best known Hunter trap. It is most likely the second most reliable AOE spell in the
Hunter arsenal (after Unleash the Hounds) and it also hits the enemy face.

It is a core card in Face Hunter decks because it serves two uses at the same time: an offensive one by doing 2 damage
to the enemy hero and a defensive one by clearing smaller minions once the Hunter is attacked.

Explosive Trap is a common part of the Face Hunter "trap package": Explosive Trap - Eaglehorn Bow - Mad Scientist. But
it is also seen as a 1-of in more control oriented Hunter decks.

* * *

<img alt="Freezing Trap" src="/images/common/freezing-trap.png" style="float: right;">

#### Freezing Trap

Freezing Trap is the control twin of Explosive Trap. Freezing Trap is a great trap as it provides both tempo and value
in the same package: tempo because it removes an enemy threat from the board, value because the minion removed costs 2
more to play, therefore putting the enemy at a mana deficit (a 1 mana Abusive Sergeant provides great value, a 3 mana
Abusive Sergeant... not so much).

Freezing Trap is very common in Midrange Hunter decks because this type of Hunter does fight for the board early with
cheap, efficient minions and weapons. Once the early game is over Freezing Trap ensures that the Midrange Hunter
minions, on average smaller than the enemy ones, can be safe from enemy trades.

Freezing Trap is a part of the Midrange Hunter "trap package": same things as for Explosive Trap, just with the trap
replaces. It is also seen sometimes as a 1-of in Face Hunter decks.

* * *

<img alt="Savannah Highmane" src="/images/common/savannah-highmane.png" style="float: right;">

#### Savannah Highmane

For 6 mana, Savannah Highmane provides 10/9 worth of stats, split into 3 beast minions: a 6/5 lion and two 2/2 hyenas
which are created by the lion's deathrattle.

Savannah Highmane provides a ton of value for its cost. On top of that its stats are awesomely distributed: the lion
hits hard or trades 2-for-1 with smaller minions while the hyenas trade 1-for-1 with most small minions.

On top of this, all 3 minions are beast so they activate beast synergy cards such as <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/488-kill-command">Kill Command</a>.

A common saying is: "if Highmane hit your face, you're going to lose". Often true.

* * *

| --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/210-snake-trap">Snake Trap</a> | Combos well with Knife Juggler and provides beast synergy. |

## Mage

<img alt="Archmage Antonidas" src="/images/common/archmage-antonidas.png" style="float: right;">

#### Archmage Antonidas

The former leader of the mages in [Dalaran](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Dalaran), Antonidas is one of the most
threatening late game minions in the game. He often serves as a secondary win condition for all kinds of decks, once
their main game plan fails (for Tempo Mages the main game plan is to kill the opponent with cheap and efficient spells
and minions and for Freeze Mage the main game plan is to nuke down the enemy in 1 big turn).

For 7 mana you get a 5/7 minion with the ability to create an infinite number of fireball. This ability means that every
Warriors with 40 armor can be killed, provided that Antonidas is not killed quickly enough.

Antonidas is seen in all mage decks, with the possible exception of Face Mage decks (which are quite rare).

* * *

<img alt="Mana Wyrm" src="/images/common/mana-wyrm.png" style="float: right;">

#### Mana Wyrm

Mana Wyrm is the definition of a "snowballing" minion: a minion that can, if not killed, win the game on its own. For 1
mana you get a 1/3 minion that gets +1 damage for each spell cast.

In a deck built around cheap, efficient spells, Mana Wyrm can even reach 6-7 damage, allowing the Mage to kill the
opponent through sheer face pounding.

Mana Wyrm is such a threatening minion it can force removal, providing great value considering the fact that Mana Wyrm costs 1
mana and most removal costs more than 1 mana.

* * *

<img alt="Sorcerer's Apprentice" src="/images/common/sorcerers-apprentice.png" style="float: right;">

#### Sorcerer's Apprentice

The second "dagger" in the Tempo Mage arsenal is the other small, threatening minion: Sorcerer's Apprentice. While the
minion itself is not as dangerous as Mana Wyrm, the effect is very powerful: every spell cast while Sorcerer's
Apprentice is on the board costs 1 less mana.

This allows you to have "power turns" where you unload a hand full of spells, usually gaining back board control or
severely crippling your opponent.

Tip: don't play Sorcerer's Apprentice alone on the board (i.e. on turn 2), unless you are really sure that the enemy has
no removal or you're in a desperate position.

* * *

{% include inline-image.html alt="Flamecannon" %}

#### Flamecannon

Great removal spell for Mages, since coupled with their hero ability, other spells and small minions Flamecannon can
actually be "targeted": the other targets are removed before Flamecannon is used and the very efficient and powerful
minion removal spell does its job.

Because it is random it can also hit stealthed minions such as <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/7730-shade-of-naxxramas">Shade of Naxxramas</a>, surprisingly turning the
randomness factor in a strong benefit in many situations.

Flamecannon is seen in all Tempo Mage decks as well as most other aggro or midrange Tempo Decks, since it provides
strong minion removal at a very low mana cost.

* * *

{% include inline-image.html alt="Unstable Portal" %}

#### Unstable Portal

Unstable Portal is a very strange spell: it costs 2 mana and it provides a random minion that costs 3 less mana when
played. It has a very obvious drawback: the minion created is random. So there are situations when you pay 2 mana to get
a 1/1 minion. And there are also situations where you pay 2 mana to get a 12 mana minion such as <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/264-mountain-giant">Mountain Giant</a>, which you might not be able to play.

However, when Unstable Portal does provide a useful minion, that minion might win you the game on its own. Since
Unstable Portal doesn't cost that much mana and since in a certain percentage of games it just wins the game for you on
its own, Unstable Portal has found a home in many competitive decks.

This powerful swing factor, coupled with the fact that it is a spell and as a result it benefits from effects such as
mana cost reduction or proccing of abilities which trigger on spell cast (<a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/263-mana-wyrm">Mana Wyrm</a> and <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/14445-flamewaker">Flamewaker</a> come to mind), have turned a fun card into a
staple of competitive decks.

* * *

{% include inline-image.html alt="Mirror Entity" %}

#### Mirror Entity

Probably the most common Mage secret used, Mirror Entity provides either a powerful tempo swing or a deterrent against
big enemy minions.

Mirror Entity is used successfully in almost all Mage Decks, going from aggro decks to control ones, with an emphasis on
the more active decks, such as Mech Mage or Tempo Mage.

It does sometimes backfire, such as when the opponent tosses himself a <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/683-zombie-chow">Zombie Chow</a> into Mirror Entity or even worse, a <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/467-doomsayer">Doomsayer</a> is used by the opponent to clear the Mage's solid
board.

Still, Mirror Entity is one of the most very reliable Mage secrets and this continues to make it a very popular Mage card.

* * *

{% include inline-image.html alt="Ice Block" %}

#### Ice Block

Ice Block is one of the few cards in the game that have enabled deck types to appear around it. It is a core card in
most Control Mage decks as well as in the (in)famous Freeze Mage deck. It makes the Mage immune to damage for a turn
when the Mage is about to be killed.

This means that the Mage has 1 more turn to do what he/she wants to do. Since there are 2 such secrets in a deck it can
actually buy 2 turns, on its own, if not destroyed (<a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/630-flare">Flare</a>) or
stolen (<a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12252-kezan-mystic">Kezan Mystic</a>). Since the counters are so
precisely targeted, they tend to not be used on ladder that much since they can be dead cards in many other match ups.

As a result, Ice Block frequently does what it should, making it a very reliable Mage secret. It is not used in most
Aggro or Tempo oriented Mage decks as those decks would rather finish the game quickly than stall the game.

As a warning: don't trigger things which might kill you during your turn (<a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12361-boom-bot">Boom Bots</a>, for example), since secrets proc on enemy turns.
This means you might kill yourself :wink:

{% include inline-image.html alt="Ice Barrier" %}

* * *

#### Ice Barrier

A frequent companion to Ice Block, Ice Barrier is the "softer" version. It does not prevent death, outright, but it does
grant a bit of armor which frequently helps the Mage survive another turn.

Ice Barrier is seen almost as much as Ice Block in Mage decks, but sometimes only 1 copy is used since its effect is not
as powerful as Ice Block's effect.

Ice Barrier, being a secret, also doesn't trigger on your turn. As a result the same warning about accidentally killing
yourself on your turn applies. On top of that, Ice Barrier is only activated if the enemy hero or minions hit your face.
So if the enemy can kill you just with spells, Ice Barrier won't provide any armor and won't save you.

Still, Ice Barrier is quite a popular secret in many Control Mage, Echo Mage and of course Freeze Mage decks.

* * *

{% include inline-image.html alt="Snowchugger" %}

#### Snowchugger

Snowchugger is a core Mech Mage minion. He is resilient (2 mana 2/3) with a freeze effect on minions. This effect is
very handy for freezing enemy minions, larger or small, or even better, freezing the opponent's face when they're
wielding a weapon (it's especially good against Warrior or Rogues, who frequently have key weapon turns, so freezing
them just at that time blocks out a very powerful enemy move).

The fact that he has 3 health also helps with Mech Mage's general plan of flooding the board, since the 3 health is
quite resistant to smaller AOEs and requires bigger and more powerful AOEs for clean up.

While that big AOE is coming, the damage from the (hopefully) full board will pile up, while Snowchugger protects
threatening minions with its freeze effect.

* * *

<img alt="Goblin Blastmage" src="/images/common/goblin-blastmage.png" style="float: right;">

#### Goblin Blastmage

Another core Mech Mage minion, Goblin Blastmage is probably the reason why Mech Mage decks are viable. The 4 mana 5/4
minion has a powerful battlecry: it deals 4 damage randomly split among enemy targets.

If the is successfully triggered on turn 4 (this requires having a mech on board), the 4 random damage is generally
enough to clear the board or do quite a bit of face damage.

Goblin Blastmage is a great tempo minion as it can either help recover from a mediocre start or cement an already decent
lead.

* * *


{% include inline-image.html alt="Blizzard" %}

#### Blizzard

<a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/44-flamestrike">Flamestrike's</a> baby brother. It doesn't do as much damage as
Flamestrike, but this drawback is partially compensated by the fact that Blizzard freezes enemy minions, preventing them
from attacking for 1 turn.

This makes Blizzard a staple of Freeze Mage and a fan-favorite in most Control Mage decks. Grinder Mages, Echo Mages and
all Mages which don't fit in the Aggro or Tempo categories use it. Sometimes it is even seen in more aggressive decks as
it allows the Mage to buy a bit more time to be able to race the opponent effectively.

* * *

## Paladin

{% include inline-image.html alt="Shielded Minibot" %}

#### Shielded Minibot

A long time ago Paladin was considered one of the worst classes in Hearthstone. Shielded Minibot has been on of the
first cards that has turned Uther's fate around.

Shielded Minibot is a sticky 2-drop that trades well against common 2 drops such as <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/422-knife-juggler">Knife
Juggler</a> and can even trade up, trading 1-for-1 with 3 or even 4 drops.

The divine shield also makes it sticky against AOE, making the small bot a real pain the neck to remove from the board.

Shielded Minibot is seem in almost all Paladin decks, going from the very aggressive Face Paladin to Secret Paladin to
Midrange Paladin and even most Control Paladins.
