This article is a part of the *Hearthcraft* series of article, where I present the best cards to craft if you want to
have a rich card collection that will allow you to create as many powerful decks with a minimal investment of [cash or
time]({% post_url 15-09-2015-cash-time-gold-dust %}).

I'll be presenting the cards which I think are the most efficient Hunter cards. When I say "efficient" I mean that these
cards have a great ratio of **power level** (how strong the cards actually are) coupled **flexibility** (if they can be used in
multiple decks and deck types) to **cost** (how much $$$ or time or gold/arcane dust you have to spend on them).

Unlike Druids and Mages Hunter cards do not have a very clear theme. Most of them are beasts, but not all of them. Some
of them are quite versatile while others fit a single role. But, overall, Hunter cards are veered towards doing damage,
to emphasize the DPS role expected from the class with the most damaging hero ability.

If you're looking for neutral cards (for example you might be wondering why <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12182-dr-boom">Dr. Boom</a> isn't here), then you should head over here:

* [Best neutral common cards to craft]({% post_url 2015-11-19-hearthcraft-key-commons %})

Now that you've finished the articles about the neutral cards and are wondering which Hunter cards you should craft
first, read on :wink:

## Hunter

<img alt="Unleash the Hounds" src="/images/common/unleash-the-hounds.png" style="float: right;">

#### Unleash the Hounds

Probably one of the most hated Hunter cards. For 3 mana you get one 1/1 hound with charge for each enemy minions. As a
result Unleash the Hounds punishes decks that flood the board with small minions. This, on its own, would be a decent
effect. But in combination with <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/422-knife-juggler">Knife Juggler</a> the effect
is even stronger as for each dog with charge there's also a random ping (1 damage hit) on enemy minions.

To add insult to injury, the hounds are beasts. Which means that enable the supercharged, 5-damage version of <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/488-kill-command">Kill Command</a>. A full Knife Juggler - Unleash the Hounds -
Kill Command combo can do up to 17 face damage against a full enemy board and if all the knives hit the enemy's face.

Unleash the Hounds is played in Face Hunter decks (extremely aggressive Hunter decks which mostly hit the enemy's face)
as well as in slower Hunter decks. Its role varies from burst face damage to board control of even a combination of
both.

<img alt="Eaglehorn Bow" src="/images/common/eaglehorn-bow.png" style="float: right;">

#### Eaglehorn Bow

The signature Hunter weapon. For 3 mana you get a 3 attack / 2 durability weapon that gets another charge when a friendly secret is
revealed.

This might not sounds like much since <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/632-fiery-war-axe">Fiery War Axe</a>
(lovingly nicknamed "Fiery Win Axe") costs 2 mana for a 3/2 weapon. But since the Bow gets another charge for each
friendly secret revealed, Eaglehorn Bow can become a 3/3 or even a 3/4 weapon if enough secrets are revealed.

And revealing secrets is easy for most Hunters as <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/7748-mad-scientist">Mad
Scientist</a> is a popular card in Hunter decks.

Eaglehorn bow is used both for face damage (Face Hunters) or board control (Midrange Hunters).

<img alt="Glaivezooka" src="/images/common/glaivezooka.png" style="float: right;">

#### Glaivezooka

Another fan favorite, Glaivezooka. For 2 mana you get a 2/2 weapon that buffs a random minion on the board, giving it +1
damage.

Initially considered a rather weak weapon (the gold standard for 2 mana weapons being the aforementioned 3/2 Fiery Win
Axe), it's utility was quickly discovered and Glaivezooka started appearing in more and more decks. The early adopters
were Face Hunters but soon Midrange Hunters started using at least 1 copy as well.

Great for trading up (the buffed minion can kill a bigger enemy minion), clearing the board or... going face :smile:

<img alt="Explosive Trap" src="/images/common/explosive-trap.png" style="float: right;">

#### Explosive Trap

Explosive Trap is probably the best known Hunter trap. It is most likely the second most reliable AOE spell in the
Hunter arsenal (after Unleash the Hounds) and it also hits the enemy face.

It is a core card in Face Hunter decks because it serves two uses at the same time: an offensive one by doing 2 damage
to the enemy hero and a defensive one by clearing smaller minions once the Hunter is attacked.

Explosive Trap is a common part of the Face Hunter "trap package": Explosive Trap - Eaglehorn Bow - Mad Scientist. But
it is also seen as a 1-of in more control oriented Hunter decks.

<img alt="Freezing Trap" src="/images/common/freezing-trap.png" style="float: right;">

#### Freezing Trap

Freezing Trap is the control twin of Explosive Trap. Freezing Trap is a great trap as it provides both tempo and value
in the same package: tempo because it removes an enemy threat from the board, value because the minion removed costs 2
more to play, therefore putting the enemy at a mana deficit (a 1 mana Abusive Sergeant provides great value, a 3 mana
Abusive Sergeant... not so much).

Freezing Trap is very common in Midrange Hunter decks because this type of Hunter does fight for the board early with
cheap, efficient minions and weapons. Once the early game is over Freezing Trap ensures that the Midrange Hunter
minions, on average smaller than the enemy ones, can be safe from enemy trades.

Freezing Trap is a part of the Midrange Hunter "trap package": same things as for Explosive Trap, just with the trap
replaces. It is also seen sometimes as a 1-of in Face Hunter decks.

<img alt="Savannah Highmane" src="/images/common/savannah-highmane.png" style="float: right;">

#### Savannah Highmane

For 6 mana, Savannah Highmane provides 10/9 worth of stats, split into 3 beast minions: a 6/5 lion and two 2/2 hyenas
which are created by the lion's deathrattle.

Savannah Highmane provides a ton of value for its cost. On top of that its stats are awesomely distributed: the lion
hits hard or trades 2-for-1 with smaller minions while the hyenas trade 1-for-1 with most small minions.

On top of this, all 3 minions are beast so they activate beast synergy cards such as <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/488-kill-command">Kill Command</a>.

A common saying is: "if Highmane hit your face, you're going to lose". Often true.
