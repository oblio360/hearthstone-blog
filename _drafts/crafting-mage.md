This article is a part of the *Hearthcraft* series of article, where I present the best cards to craft if you want to
have a rich card collection that will allow you to create as many powerful decks with a minimal investment of [cash or
time]({% post_url 15-09-2015-cash-time-gold-dust %}).

I'll be presenting the cards which I think are the most efficient Mage cards. When I say "efficient" I mean that these
cards have a great ratio of **power level** (how strong the cards actually are) coupled **flexibility** (if they can be used in
multiple decks and deck types) to **cost** (how much $$$ or time or gold/arcane dust you have to spend on them).

Mage cards have a very clear theme: comboing with spells. Most of the Mage cards get various benefits from being used
immediately before or after a spell has been used. Some of them can even generate spells you can then use.

If you're looking for neutral cards (for example you might be wondering why <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12182-dr-boom">Dr. Boom</a> isn't here), then you should head over here:

* [Best neutral common cards to craft]({% post_url 2015-11-19-hearthcraft-key-commons %})

Now that you've finished the articles about the neutral cards and are wondering which Druid cards you should craft
first, read on :wink:

## Mage

<img alt="Archmage Antonidas" src="/images/common/archmage-antonidas.png" style="float: right;">

#### Archmage Antonidas

The former leader of the mages in [Dalaran](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Dalaran), Antonidas is one of the most
threatening late game minions in the game. He often serves as a secondary win condition for all kinds of decks, once
their main game plan fails (for Tempo Mages the main game plan is to kill the opponent with cheap and efficient spells
and minions and for Freeze Mage the main game plan is to nuke down the enemy in 1 big turn).

For 7 mana you get a 5/7 minion with the ability to create an infinite number of fireball. This ability means that every
Warriors with 40 armor can be killed, provided that Antonidas is not killed quickly enough.

Antonidas is seen in all mage decks, with the possible exception of Face Mage decks (which are quite rare).

* * *

<img alt="Mana Wyrm" src="/images/common/mana-wyrm.png" style="float: right;">

#### Mana Wyrm

Mana Wyrm is the definition of a "snowballing" minion: a minion that can, if not killed, win the game on its own. For 1
mana you get a 1/3 minion that gets +1 damage for each spell cast.

In a deck built around cheap, efficient spells, Mana Wyrm can even reach 6-7 damage, allowing the Mage to kill the
opponent through sheer face pounding.

Mana Wyrm is such a threatening minion it can force removal, providing great value considering the fact that Mana Wyrm costs 1
mana and most removal costs more than 1 mana.

* * *

<img alt="Sorcerer's Apprentice" src="/images/common/sorcerers-apprentice.png" style="float: right;">

#### Sorcerer's Apprentice

The second "dagger" in the Tempo Mage arsenal is the other small, threatening minion: Sorcerer's Apprentice. While the
minion itself is not as dangerous as Mana Wyrm, the effect is very powerful: every spell cast while Sorcerer's
Apprentice is on the board costs 1 less mana.

This allows you to have "power turns" where you unload a hand full of spells, usually gaining back board control or
severely crippling your opponent.

Tip: don't play Sorcerer's Apprentice alone on the board (i.e. on turn 2), unless you are really sure that the enemy has
no removal or you're in a desperate position.

* * *

{% include inline-image.html alt="Flamecannon" %}

#### Flamecannon

Great removal spell for Mages, since coupled with their hero ability, other spells and small minions Flamecannon can
actually be "targeted": the other targets are removed before Flamecannon is used and the very efficient and powerful
minion removal spell does its job.

Because it is random it can also hit stealthed minions such as <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/7730-shade-of-naxxramas">Shade of Naxxramas</a>, surprisingly turning the
randomness factor in a strong benefit in many situations.

Flamecannon is seen in all Tempo Mage decks as well as most other aggro or midrange Tempo Decks, since it provides
strong minion removal at a very low mana cost.

* * *

{% include inline-image.html alt="Unstable Portal" %}

#### Unstable Portal

Unstable Portal is a very strange spell: it costs 2 mana and it provides a random minion that costs 3 less mana when
played. It has a very obvious drawback: the minion created is random. So there are situations when you pay 2 mana to get
a 1/1 minion. And there are also situations where you pay 2 mana to get a 12 mana minion such as <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/264-mountain-giant">Mountain Giant</a>, which you might not be able to play.

However, when Unstable Portal does provide a useful minion, that minion might win you the game on its own. Since
Unstable Portal doesn't cost that much mana and since in a certain percentage of games it just wins the game for you on
its own, Unstable Portal has found a home in many competitive decks.

This powerful swing factor, coupled with the fact that it is a spell and as a result it benefits from effects such as
mana cost reduction or proccing of abilities which trigger on spell cast (<a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/263-mana-wyrm">Mana Wyrm</a> and <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/14445-flamewaker">Flamewaker</a> come to mind), have turned a fun card into a
staple of competitive decks.

* * *

{% include inline-image.html alt="Mirror Entity" %}

#### Mirror Entity

Probably the most common Mage secret used, Mirror Entity provides either a powerful tempo swing or a deterrent against
big enemy minions.

Mirror Entity is used successfully in almost all Mage Decks, going from aggro decks to control ones, with an emphasis on
the more active decks, such as Mech Mage or Tempo Mage.

It does sometimes backfire, such as when the opponent tosses himself a <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/683-zombie-chow">Zombie Chow</a> into Mirror Entity or even worse, a <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/467-doomsayer">Doomsayer</a> is used by the opponent to clear the Mage's solid
board.

Still, Mirror Entity is one of the most very reliable Mage secrets and this continues to make it a very popular Mage card.

* * *

{% include inline-image.html alt="Ice Block" %}

#### Ice Block

Ice Block is one of the few cards in the game that have enabled deck types to appear around it. It is a core card in
most Control Mage decks as well as in the (in)famous Freeze Mage deck. It makes the Mage immune to damage for a turn
when the Mage is about to be killed.

This means that the Mage has 1 more turn to do what he/she wants to do. Since there are 2 such secrets in a deck it can
actually buy 2 turns, on its own, if not destroyed (<a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/630-flare">Flare</a>) or
stolen (<a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12252-kezan-mystic">Kezan Mystic</a>). Since the counters are so
precisely targeted, they tend to not be used on ladder that much since they can be dead cards in many other match ups.

As a result, Ice Block frequently does what it should, making it a very reliable Mage secret. It is not used in most
Aggro or Tempo oriented Mage decks as those decks would rather finish the game quickly than stall the game.

As a warning: don't trigger things which might kill you during your turn (<a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12361-boom-bot">Boom Bots</a>, for example), since secrets proc on enemy turns.
This means you might kill yourself :wink:

{% include inline-image.html alt="Ice Barrier" %}

* * *

#### Ice Barrier

A frequent companion to Ice Block, Ice Barrier is the "softer" version. It does not prevent death, outright, but it does
grant a bit of armor which frequently helps the Mage survive another turn.

Ice Barrier is seen almost as much as Ice Block in Mage decks, but sometimes only 1 copy is used since its effect is not
as powerful as Ice Block's effect.

Ice Barrier, being a secret, also doesn't trigger on your turn. As a result the same warning about accidentally killing
yourself on your turn applies. On top of that, Ice Barrier is only activated if the enemy hero or minions hit your face.
So if the enemy can kill you just with spells, Ice Barrier won't provide any armor and won't save you.

Still, Ice Barrier is quite a popular secret in many Control Mage, Echo Mage and of course Freeze Mage decks.

* * *

{% include inline-image.html alt="Snowchugger" %}

#### Snowchugger

Snowchugger is a core Mech Mage minion. He is resilient (2 mana 2/3) with a freeze effect on minions. This effect is
very handy for freezing enemy minions, larger or small, or even better, freezing the opponent's face when they're
wielding a weapon (it's especially good against Warrior or Rogues, who frequently have key weapon turns, so freezing
them just at that time blocks out a very powerful enemy move).

The fact that he has 3 health also helps with Mech Mage's general plan of flooding the board, since the 3 health is
quite resistant to smaller AOEs and requires bigger and more powerful AOEs for clean up.

While that big AOE is coming, the damage from the (hopefully) full board will pile up, while Snowchugger protects
threatening minions with its freeze effect.

* * *

<img alt="Goblin Blastmage" src="/images/common/goblin-blastmage.png" style="float: right;">

#### Goblin Blastmage

Another core Mech Mage minion, Goblin Blastmage is probably the reason why Mech Mage decks are viable. The 4 mana 5/4
minion has a powerful battlecry: it deals 4 damage randomly split among enemy targets.

If the is successfully triggered on turn 4 (this requires having a mech on board), the 4 random damage is generally
enough to clear the board or do quite a bit of face damage.

Goblin Blastmage is a great tempo minion as it can either help recover from a mediocre start or cement an already decent
lead.

* * *


{% include inline-image.html alt="Blizzard" %}

#### Blizzard

<a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/44-flamestrike">Flamestrike's</a> baby brother. It doesn't do as much damage as
Flamestrike, but this drawback is partially compensated by the fact that Blizzard freezes enemy minions, preventing them
from attacking for 1 turn.

This makes Blizzard a staple of Freeze Mage and a fan-favorite in most Control Mage decks. Grinder Mages, Echo Mages and
all Mages which don't fit in the Aggro or Tempo categories use it. Sometimes it is even seen in more aggressive decks as
it allows the Mage to buy a bit more time to be able to race the opponent effectively.
