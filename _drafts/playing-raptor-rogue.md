[League of Explorers (LoE)]({% post_url 2015-11-13-league-of-explorers-reviews %}) has brought with it several deck
types enabled by newly added cards.

{% include inline-image.html alt="Unearthed Raptor" %}

One of the classes which have gotten a new deck type has been Rogue, as a result of the introduction of Unearthed
Raptor. Unearthed Raptor is a 3 mana 3/4 minion with a very powerful battlecry effect: it can copy the deathrattle of
any friendly minion, thus having its own deathrattle.

This has enabled Rogue, which was traditionally a spell-based class, to focus on a more minion-heavy play style. Some
people have even gone so far as to call it "Zoo". The new, minion-based deck is commonly known as "Raptor Rogue" or
"Deathrattle Rogue".

The general idea is simple: since Unearthed Raptor is a midgame minion which can copy powerful deathrattles, just create
a deck which includes the most powerful deathrattles.

Deathrattles from <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/513-leper-gnome">Leper Gnome</a> to <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12187-sneeds-old-shredder">Sneed's Old Shredder</a> have been tested in Raptor
Rogue decks, with varying degrees of success at all levels of play.

Here I'll present my own variation of Raptor Rogue, with a card-by-card explanation for things I've included and thing's
I've excluded that might be alternatives to my choices, as well as a mulligan guide and a general game play guide.

I've managed to reach legend with this variation and I think that the deck is competitive. If I haven't reached higher
legend ranks it's just because I'm not a good enough player and I couldn't exploit the deck to its full potential.

## Deck list

Cards included:

* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/471-backstab">Backstab</a> - very cheap and efficient removal, hard to take
  out of any Rogue deck; used to clear smaller minion or to add some chip damage when killing a bigger minion.
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/92-cold-blood">Cold Blood</a> - Nerubian Egg activator, allows trading up
  minions, racing aggro decks and giving extra reach for lethal.
* 2x Abusive Sergeant - Nerubian Egg activator, allows trading up minions, racing aggro decks and giving extra reach for
  lethal (the minion form of Cold Blood :smile:).
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/382-eviscerate">Eviscerate</a> - Backstab's bigger brother that can also
  hit face; used to clear very threatening small minions or bigger minions or as burst damage when going for lethal.
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/7756-haunted-creeper">Haunted Creeper</a> - deathrattle, sticky minion that
  can fight off aggro minions and also provides several bodies which can be used (& abused) by Coldblood, Abusive
  Sergeant or Defender of Argus.
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/395-loot-hoarder">Loot Hoarder</a> - deathrattle, cheap and efficient
  minion that also draws a card; used early game to fend off aggro and late game to draw more cards together with Raptor
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/7738-nerubian-egg">Nerubian Egg</a> - deathrattle of great value,
  especially when comboed with Raptor; used to build up a board which is very resilient to board clears.
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/378-fan-of-knives">Fan of Knives</a> - good AOE against aggro also provides
  more card draw
* 1x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/73-big-game-hunter">Big Game Hunter</a> - cleanest solution to Dr. Boom,
  also used against Mysterious Challenger (when buffed) or against Giants; overall, most efficient solution to big
  minions.
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/27220-unearthed-raptor">Unearthed Raptor</a> - the card that started it
  all; solid 3 mana 3/4 minion that is extremely versatile and can provide a sticky board, more card draw or even
  special deathrattle effects (Sylvanas, Boom Bot) when needed.
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/542-defender-of-argus">Defender of Argus</a> - egg activator, anti-aggro
  card, allows trading up minions, racing aggro decks and giving extra reach for lethal; all round, great card in this
  deck.
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12191-piloted-shredder">Piloted Shredder</a> - deathrattle and [all-round
  best 4 mana minion in the game]({% post_url 2015-11-19-hearthcraft-key-commons %}).
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/280-azure-drake">Azure Drake</a> - card draw, +1 spell damage for more
  efficient minion removal or better reach for lethal and on top of that a decent minion body.
* 1x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/14434-dark-iron-skulker">Dark Iron Skuler</a> - another, slightly more
  powerful AOE that also leaves a 4/3 minion behind.
* 2x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/7749-sludge-belcher">Sludge Belcher</a> - deathrattle, double taunt to
  block aggro.
* 1x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/33-sylvanas-windrunner">Sylvanas Windrunner</a> - another deathrattle and a
  decent 5/5 body; great in control matchups especially against classes where you want to block a big drop; copying the
  deathrattle with the Raptor can be strong as it can potentially block 2 powerful turns from your opponent.
* 1x <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12182-dr-boom">Dr. Boom</a> - more deathrattles on top of probably the [best
  7 mana minion in the game]({% post_url 2015-11-19-hearthcraft-key-commons %}).

## Game plan

The general game plan is similar to that of Zoo: get control of the board early and don't let it go. If you do lose it,
unlike Zoo, there are some comeback mechanisms in Fan of Knives and Dark Iron Skulker, but they're not powerful enough
to turn a game around on their own if the board has been lost completely.

Against aggro decks and almost every kind of deck except for super late game control, you're the control deck. There's
no healing in the deck so once you get too low you're probably dead. However, with your very cheap and efficient
removal, small and sticky minions and your hero power, winning the board around round 4 should be achievable in most
games.

The perfect game start would be:

* Turn 1: Coin / Nerubian Egg
* Turn 2: Haunted Creeper or Backstab + hero power to kill the opposing minion
* Turn 3: Raptor on the Nerubian Egg
* Turn 4: Piloted Shredder
* Turns 5 & later: solidify the board, preferably by keeping deathrattles so that enemy AOE cannot wipe your board

#### Favorable match ups

Secret Paladin, Aggro Druid, Midrange Hunter, Hybrid Hunter, Control Warrior running only 1 copy of Brawl, Handlock if
you get Big Game Hunter before turn 4.

### Unfavorable match ups

Dragon Priest, Renolock, Face Hunter, Aggro Shaman.

## Mulligans
