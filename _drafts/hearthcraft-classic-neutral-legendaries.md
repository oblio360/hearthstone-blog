Hello, I'm *oblio* and I'll be your host for a new series called "Which cards should I craft first as a new
Hearthstone player?". That's a mouth-full, so I'll just call it "HearthCraft" from now on :smile:

One of the most important things as a new player is to decide which cards you're going to craft with your spare dust.
Unless your name is Donald Trump, you're probably going to want to not throw a lot of
:heavy_dollar_sign::heavy_dollar_sign::heavy_dollar_sign: on cards you will later not use.

Hearthstone has a lot of cards so I've decided to make several articles about this topic, each one of them covering a
different part of the ever-growing Hearthstone collection. As new expansions appear I will publish new articles, so stay
tuned!
