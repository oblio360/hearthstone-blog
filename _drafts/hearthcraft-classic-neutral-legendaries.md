---

Hello, I'm *oblio* and I'll be your host for a new series called "Which cards should I craft first as a new
Hearthstone player?". That's a mouth-full, so I'll just call it "HearthCraft" from now on :smile:

One of the most important things as a new player is to decide which cards you're going to craft with your spare dust.
Unless your name is Donald Trump, you're probably going to want to not throw a lot of
:heavy_dollar_sign::heavy_dollar_sign::heavy_dollar_sign: on cards you will later not use.

Hearthstone has a lot of cards so I've decided to make several articles about this topic, each one of them covering a
different part of the ever-growing Hearthstone collection. As new expansions appear I will publish new articles, so stay
tuned!

* HearthCraft Episode 1: Classic set - neutral legendaries (you are here)
* HearthCraft Episode 2: Classic set - neutral epics
* HearthCraft Episode 3: Classic set - neutral rares (part 1)
* HearthCraft Episode 4: Classic set - neutral rares (part 2)
* HearthCraft Episode 5: Classic set - neutral commons (part 1)
* HearthCraft Episode 6: Classic neutral commons (part 2)

Let's get started. I'll list the cards according to their crafting priority.

Keep in mind that this guide is meant for players who want to make a collection as large as possible, so that they can
play a varied collection of decks at their full potential. If you're someone who loves to play the same class or
archetype over and over and over again, your crafting priority will be different and most likely entirely focused on
the class or archetype you love.

# Must have

These are the cards that are most likely to be used in decks you create or you find on the internet. They are so
powerful or versatile that most players would consider them better than the alternatives.

## Sylvannas Windrunner

<img alt="Sylvannas Windrunner" src="/images/common/sylvannas-windrunner.png" style="float: right;">

Sylvannas is a staple of many control and midrange decks. Besides the solid 5/5 body she comes with a game-swinging
deathrattle: she steals an enemy minion. As a 5/5 she can deal with most aggro deck minions (which are usually high
attack - low HP minions) or she can suicide into the control deck's "bomb" and steal the damage unit after she dies.
Either way, decent against aggro and a huge swing against midrange and control decks. She tends to provoke awkward
trades or overextension by board flooding (thus playing directly into AOE).

Sylvannas can be seen in a large number of decks and she has "survived" 2 expansions and 2 adventures already. Unless
major [power creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_creep) occurs, she will still be seen in many decks in the
future.

*I have no time for games. (really?)*

## Ysera

<img alt="Ysera" src="/images/common/ysera.png" style="float:right;">

Ysera is the veteran "control dragon". She has a solid 4/12 body which is quite hard to kill unless you have direct
removal when she is played. If not answered she starts creating special cards called ["Dream
Cards"](http://hearthstone.wikia.com/wiki/Dream_Card#Dream_Cards). These cards range from decent (3 mana untargetable
3/5, 4 mana dragon 7/6) to strong (0 mana return minion to owner's hand, 0 mana give minion 5/5 then destroy it next
turn) to almost overpowered (2 mana deal 5 damage to all characters except Ysera).

Against aggro decks and midrange decks the body can trade at least 2-to-1, while the dream cards can at minimum provide
additional bodies to throw on the table and at best can provide additional reach for a surprise lethal while racing.
Aggro decks are less affected by Ysera as by turn 9, when she is usually played, they are close to killing the enemy and
Ysera doesn't have an immediate effect on the board or on either player's HP.

Besides the advantages mentioned against aggro and midrange decks, against control decks the body usually trades at
least 1-to-1 while the dream cards provide another stream of cards allowing the Ysera player to avoid drawing and going
into fatigue first.

Overall, a very solid card in slower metas and a staple of the dragon "tribe".

*I dream and the world trembles.*

## Alexstrasza

<img alt="Alexstrasza" src="/images/common/alexstrasza.png" style="float:right;">

Alexstrasza is another veteran from the dragon "tribe". She can be seen in control and combo decks. Depending on the
situation Alexstrasza is either used to do up to 15 damage to the enemy's face (maybe allowing lethal next turn) or to
heal for up to 15 damage. On top of the instant effect she brings a 8/8 body which trades well with most enemy minions
or forces the usage of direct removal. Even if the enemy uses removal on the body, the effect has already taken place,
and it is a very powerful effect in many circumstances.

Especially for new players Alexstrasza provides one of the best examples of "good card": instant, powerful effect on the
game.

*I bring life and hope.*

## Ragnaros the Firelord

<img alt="Ragnaros the Firelord" src="/images/common/ragnaros-the-firelord.png" style="float:right;">

Ragnaros is staple of midrange or control decks. He is a weird minion, more like a turret than an actual minion, since he
cannot attack directly. Instead, at the end of the round he does 8 damage to a random enemy target. You can think of him
as a [Demolisher](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Demolisher) on steroids.

Ragnaros is the epitome of big threat: 8 mana for 8/8 stats, does 8 damage to a random enemy. In most situations he
cannot be ignored so he is used as a sort of "timer".

Against aggro decks he is only used to race while against midrange and control decks he is usually used for a 50-50
chance of destroying a huge enemy threat or to bring the enemy into lethal range.

*Die, insect!*

## Harrison Jones

<img alt="Harrison Jones" src="/images/common/harrison-jones.png" style="float:right;">

Harrison Jones is a bit of an odd-ball on the "must have" list. He's not the staple of any deck. With his 5/4 stats and
his quirky battlecry, he can't really be. He is however one of the most common "tech cards". Any time classes with
weapons flood the metagame, Harrison is bound to show up. Together with his smaller brother, [Acidic Swamp
Ooze](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Acidic_Swamp_Ooze). Or, for the more desperate amongst us, [Bloodsail
Corsair](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Bloodsail_Corsair).

There are 4 classes which can have weapons:

* Warrior
* Hunter
* Paladin
* Shaman

It's a good bet that any time in Hearthstone's history at least one of those classes was popular of very popular. As a
result, Harrison is a common sight in decks. Even if he's not "must have" in the sense that you can't build your deck
without him, you will want to have him in those moments of need.

Against aggro and midrange decks Harrison is used either as a vanilla 5 mana 5/4 (quite underwhelming) or as a weapon
removal in a crucial moment in the game (for example against a Hunter with a [Eaglehorn
Bow](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Eaglehorn_Bow) and a trap in play). If the midrange deck is slower he might even
be used for the second part of his battlecry, card drawing.

Against control Harrison is used in the same way, but with less emphasis on playing him without benefiting from his
battlecry, and a lot more emphasis on drawing several cards when possible.

*That belongs in a museum.*

# Nice to have

These are cards which are not seen as often in powerful decks as the "must haves". Nonetheless, they are strong cards
and depending on personal preference they can crafted sooner and you will not regret your decision.

## Malygos

<img alt="Malygos" src="/images/common/malygos.png" style="float:right;">

Also known as "the creator of many OTK videos". Malygos packs a powerful body, the same as Ysera's (4/12)
