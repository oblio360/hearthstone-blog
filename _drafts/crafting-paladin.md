This article is a part of the *Hearthcraft* series of article, where I present the best cards to craft if you want to
have a rich card collection that will allow you to create as many powerful decks with a very small investment of [cash
or time]({% post_url 15-09-2015-cash-time-gold-dust %}).

Today I'll present the best class cards to craft for Paladin, Priest and Rogue.

## Paladin

{% include inline-image.html alt="Shielded Minibot" %}

#### Shielded Minibot

A long time ago Paladin was considered one of the worst classes in Hearthstone. Shielded Minibot has been on of the
first cards that has turned Uther's fate around.

Shielded Minibot is a sticky 2-drop that trades well against common 2 drops such as <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/422-knife-juggler">Knife
Juggler</a> and can even trade up, trading 1-for-1 with 3 or even 4 drops.

The divine shield also makes it sticky against AOE, making the small bot a real pain the neck to remove from the board.

Shielded Minibot is seem in almost all Paladin decks, going from the very aggressive Face Paladin to Secret Paladin to
Midrange Paladin and even most Control Paladins.

{% include inline-image.html alt="Muster for Battle" %}

#### Muster for Battle

The second card that brought Paladin back from the dead. Muster for Battle is a very versatile spells: it puts 3 1/1 <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/268-silver-hand-recruit">Silver Hand Recruits</a> on the board (same minion as that
provided by the Paladin hero power) as well as a <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/250-lights-justice">Light's
Justice</a> weapon. While the 1/1 minions are weak individually and the weapon isn't that great on its own, the package
is really strong.

Light's Justice provides the Paladin a way to "ping" weak enemy minions (something Paladins were really lacking
previously) while the recruits can contest most enemy minions played early game.

The minions can also absorb random pings such as those from <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/422-knife-juggler">Knife Juggler</a> or from <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/14445-flamewaker">Flamewaker</a>.

Late game they can buffed by <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12280-quartermaster">Quartermaster</a> or by <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/29-blessing-of-kings">Blessing of Kings</a>.

Muster for Battles is used in the vast majority of Paladin decks, ranging from pure Aggro to total Control.

{% include inline-image.html alt="Tirion Fordring" %}

#### Tirion Fordring

Widely considered one of the best legendaries in the game, Tirion is a staple of Paladin decks.

Tirion provides a great, 6/6 body, which can trade well with most small and medium sized minions. It also comes with a
divine shield which allows it to trade up. On its own Tirion trades 1-for-1 with almost all minions in the game.

Because it only has 6 attack it dodges <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/73-big-game-hunter">Big Game Hunter</a>,
making its removal a big pain for the opponent in most situations.

On top of these benefits, it comes with a strong deathrattle: once it dies the player gets a legendary sword: <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/53-ashbringer">Ashbringer</a>.

Only the super aggressive Paladin decks do without Tirion and frequently even those use him as a finisher.

{% include inline-image.html alt="Mysterious Challenger" %}

#### Mysterious Challenger

Widely despised by players for the "brute force" playstyle it enables, Mysterious Challenger (MC) is a very, very strong
card.

It has the same 6/6 body as Tirion does but instead of the bells and whistles Tirion provides (divine shield,
deathrattle), Mysterious Challenger comes with a very strong battlecry.

Its battlecry "sucks up" one copy of each secret you have in your deck. The effect is that once MC is played, a 6/6 body
is on the board and 1 to 5 secrets are played at the same time (he's been nicknamed Madder Scientist because he's like a <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/7748-mad-scientist">Mad Scientist</a> on steroids.

Mysterious Challenger is not seen in many Paladin decks because he has created his own deck type: Secret Paladin.

As long as Secret Paladin is strong, Mysterious Challenger will be a strong card (or vice versa).

{% include inline-image.html alt="Aldor Peacekeeper" %}

#### Aldor Peacekeeper

Aldor is the oldest competitive "single minion removal" in the Paladin arsenal. The minion itself has a 3/3 body, which
is decent for a 3 mana minion. But the reason Aldor is used is because of its battlecry: it sets an enemy minion's
attack to 1.

This means that enemy giants, as well as other threats, suddenly become almost toothless. This is used either for buying
time to stabilize or to slow down the opponent while the Paladin player races to kill the opponent before he is killed
himself, once he has lost board control.

Aldor is used in almost all Paladin decks which are not purely aggressive.

* * *

{% include inline-image.html alt="Divine Favor" %}

#### Divine Favor

Divine Favor is the bane of opposing Control decks. It is seen often in decks which can empty their hand quickly. 

It is a dead card in Aggro match ups, where the opponent player empties his hand almost as quickly (if not quicker) than
the Paladin player. However, if makes up for this by being a powerful draw engine in match ups against Midrange and
especially against Control decks.

In these match ups Divine Favor frequently outperforms standard draw cards (<a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/489-arcane-intellect">Arcane Intellect</a>, for example), by drawing 3-4-5-6 or
even 7 cards in extreme cases.

Divine Favor is seen in Aggro Paladin and Secret Paladin, especially the faster Secret Paladin varieties.

* * *

{% include inline-image.html alt="Lay on Hands" %}

#### Lay on Hands

Lay on Hands is one of the slowest cards used competitively which does not affect the board directly. The reason it is
used competitively is that, despite its huge mana cost (8 mana), it provides two effects which are both strong: a 8 HP
heal (great for stabilizing) and a 3 card draw (awesome for catching up after stabilizing).

Lay on Hands is seen in slower Paladin decks such as Midrange, Control or Combo Paladins.

Frequently just 1 copy is used, only slowest of Paladin decks affording to run 2 copies.

Still, Lay on Hands is a great tool in the Paladin arsenal as a Midrange, Control or Combo Paladin counter-part to Divine Favor.

* * *

{% include inline-image.html alt="Equality" %}

#### Equality

Equality has one of the most interesting effects in the game: it does not remove enemy minions outright, it just sets
their HP to 1. Once the enemy minions have been "equalized", the arsenal of Paladin small minions (starting with the
Silver Hand recruits summoned by the Paladin hero power) can take them on on equal footing. Or even the Paladin himself,
with his weapons.

Besides this primary effect, Equality is included in 2 of the most devastating board wipe combos: <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/25-wild-pyromancer">Wild Pyromancer</a> - Equality (where the minions on both sides
are wiped out) or Equality - <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/260-consecration">Consecration</a> (where just the
opposing minions are cleared).

Unfortunately, because sometimes the opposing enemy minions have low HP to start with (Aggro decks frequently use high
attack - low HP minions), Equality is at times a dead card.

At least 1 copy is used in Midrange or Control decks, maybe more if Handlocks are running rampant in the metagame.

* * *

{% include inline-image.html alt="Avenge" %}

#### Avenge

Mysterious Challenger would not be a strong card if it would not have fitting partners in crime. Paladin secrets are
generally weak since they only cost 1 mana.

Avenge is probably the only Paladin secret which was used on its own before the introduction of Mysterious Challenger,
since the 3/2 stats given to a random friendly minion are equivalent to having a 2-mana minion on the board.

All decent Secret Paladin decks run 2 copies of Avenge. Most non-Secret Paladin decks that do run Avenge rarely run 2,
as the effect is not consistent enough for mass use outside of Secret Pally.

* * *

{% include inline-image.html alt="Noble Sacrifice" %}

#### Noble Sacrifice

Noble Sacrifice is the other constant companion to Mysterious Challenger. Before the creation of Secret Paladin it was
the second most popular Paladin secret, the 2/1 defender being useful as protection for threatening minions.

When used together with Avenge it guarantees that Avenge fires off as long as there is at least 1 friendly minion on the
board: when the Noble Sacrifice defender dies Avenge is triggered and the minion on board gets the Avenge buff.

Noble Sacrifice the other secret that has 2 copies in almost all Secret Paladin decks.

* * *

{% include inline-image.html alt="Quartermaster" %}

#### Quartermaster

Muster for Battle is a strong card on its own but it becomes a lot stronger in Control match ups with the buff from
Quartermaster.

On top of this, every Silver Hand Recruit created by the hero power suddenly becomes a much bigger worry that
previously.

Quartermaster is sometimes a dead card, since it is just a 2/5 body for 5 mana if played on an empty board, or a 4/7 for
5 mana if played when only 1 Silver Hand Recruit has been summoned. However, when the effect is triggered on top of 2 or
more recruits Quartermaster suddenly becomes very valuable.

Besides the actual in-game effect Quartermaster also has a strong psychological effect: opponents will frequently
misplay and try to awkwardly kill the summoned 1/1 minions since they won't know if the Paladin player has 1 or even 2
Quartermaster in the deck.

Quartermaster is used frequently in Midrange or Control Paladin decks.
