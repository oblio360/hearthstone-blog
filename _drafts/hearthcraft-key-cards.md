title: "Hearthcraft: key cards" 
---

At the end of the [Hearthcraft Basics](http://hearthstone.oblio360.com/2015/10/26/hearthcraft-basics/) article I
mentioned that there are some key cards which should be crafted first, and I promised I'd write a separate article about
those "key cards". Well, here is that article :smile:

I will go through all the cards in Hearthstone and I will list the best cards for each category. The categories being:

* [Neutral common cards](#neutral-commons)
* [Neutral rare cards](#neutral-rares)
* [Neutral epic cards](#neutral-epics)
* [Neutral legendaries](#neutral-legendaries)
* [Druid cards](#druid)
* [Hunter cards](#hunter)
* [Mage cards](#mage)
* [Paladin cards](#paladin)
* [Priest cards](#priest)
* [Rogue cards](#rogue)
* [Shaman cards](#shaman)
* [Warlock cards](#warlock)
* [Warrior cards](#warrior)
* [Tribal cards](#tribals)
