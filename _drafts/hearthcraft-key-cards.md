title: "Hearthcraft: key cards" 
---

At the end of the [Hearthcraft Basics](http://hearthstone.oblio360.com/2015/10/26/hearthcraft-basics/) article I
mentioned that there are some key cards which should be crafted first, and I promised I'd write a separate article about
those "key cards". Well, here is that article :smile:

I will go through all the cards in Hearthstone and I will list the best cards for each category. The categories being:

<a name="toc"><a>

* [Common neutral cards](#commons-neutrals)
* [Rare neutral cards](#rare-neutrals)
* [Epic neutral cards](#epic-neutrals)
* [Legendary neutral cards](#legendary-neutrals)

* [Hunter cards](#hunter)
* [Mage cards](#mage)
* [Paladin cards](#paladin)
* [Priest cards](#priest)
* [Rogue cards](#rogue)

### <a name="common-neutrals">Common neutral cards</a>

<img src="/images/common/piloted-shredder.png" alt="Piloted Shredder" style="float: right">

#### Piloted Shredder

The "king" of common cards in Hearthstone. Introduced in Goblins versus Gnomes, this 4 mana 4/3 minion summons a random
2 mana minion when it dies.

It is a very powerful minion because of 2 separate factors:

* it is "sticky": its removal is very awkward in most situations, requiring 2 hits, in any combination of: minion,
  weapon, direct nuke or AOE nuke
* it packs a ton of stats: under the flimsy 4/3 body (that can also trade up due to its 4 attack) the average stats of a
  2 mana minion are 2/2; as a result Shredder is basically a 4 mana 6/5 minion

Piloted Shredder can be seen in almost any kind of deck, except for the extremely aggressive ones (Face Hunter) or the
extremely greedy ones (greedy Control Warrior). But any time even those decks "move" towards midrange, they tend to
include Piloted Shredder.

<img src="/images/common/ironbeak-owl.png" alt="Ironbeak Owl" style="float: right">

#### Ironbeak Owl

Silence is a [very powerful mechanic in
Hearthstone](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/34swjq/interview_with_senior_game_designer_ben_brode_got/cqxun0c).
It's so powerful that it's literally "hidden" in the basic set (there are no silence cards that are available to a new
player when he first plays Hearthstone).

The first time a new player will use this mechanic will probably be when he gets or crafts his Ironbeak Owl.

Another staple of Hearthstone, "Hoot hoot!" as it's lovingly called by the community, is a common sight in many decks.
Aggressive decks use it to bypass taunts and to neutralize big cards with powerful effects, control decks use it to stem
the bleeding against the same aggressive decks I mentioned.

It is probably the most used "tech" card (card that's used mostly for its effect which counters a very specific, major
threat). Even if in many occasions it's only a 1-of, Ironbeak Owl sees a lot of action in Hearthstone.

The 2 mana cost 2/1 body doesn't seem much. But once it silences your <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/7749-sludge-belcher">Sludge Belcher</a> just before the <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/174-wolfrider">Wolfrider</a> and the
<a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12267-glaivezooka">Glaivezooka</a> hit you, you will see why the card is so powerful.

* * *

<img src="/images/common/leper-gnome.png" alt="Leper Gnome" style="float: right">

#### Leper Gnome

The 1 mana 2/1 body isn't impressive. But it comes with a powerful deathrattle: deal 2 damage to the enemy hero.
Leper Gnome is a staple of ultra aggressive decks. As someone called it, it is the "announcer of cancer decks" ("cancer
decks" is the not-very-sensitive name the Hearthstone community has given to decks which are extremely common and
especially very aggressive).

Leper Gnome is not flashy but it provides a guaranteed 2 damage to the enemy's face. In a well-oiled aggressive deck,
that's all you can ask from your 1 drop. Especially in the "later" turns of the game, when you need to bypass taunts.

When you hear "I feel icky!", it's time to avoid things which reduce your hero's HP, because you will miss every one of
your hit points later on.

* * *

<img src="/images/common/antique-healbot.png" alt="Antique Healbot" style="float: right">

#### Antique Healbot

A homonym for "anti-kill bot", Antique Healbot is a 5 mana 3/3 mech that heals you for 8 HP. Since he has been
introduced in the Goblins versus Gnomes expansion, Antique Healbot has been a staple of control decks.

In many control versus aggro games, the control players can be at low health levels in turn 5 or 6. This is where
Antique Healbot comes in: he heals the control player for 8, thus extending the game by 1 or 2 more turns, until the
control player can stabilize and start playing "bombs" (cards with a high mana cost and a high impact on the game).

Antique Healbot is usually played as a 1-of, or when things get really aggressive, as a 2-of.

* * *

<img src="/images/common/abusive-sergeant.png" alt="Abusive Sergeant" style="float: right">

#### Abusive Sergeant

Another flimsy 1 mana 2/1. Again, the extra text on the card makes card powerful. 

Abusive Sergeant gives a minion +2
attack the turn it is used. While it doesn't sound like much, it allows a small minion to trade with a minion which
costs 1 more mana or even 2 more mana in certain situations. It also allows a small minion to do a lot more face damage
when that's needed.

Just as his cousin, Leper Gnome, Abusive Sergeant is a staple of aggressive decks. He sometimes makes his way even into
midrange decks which need a little help with boosting their low-attack minions when they fight bigger minions.

### <a name="rare-neutrals">Rare neutral cards</a>

<img src="/images/common/knife-juggler.png" alt="Knife Juggler" style="float: right">

#### Knife Juggler

Knife Juggler, partner in aggro crime with Leper Gnome and Abusive Sergeant. If your deck is a aggro deck, there's a
huge chance that Knife Juggler is in it. Knife Juggler is so good that he's even played in midrange decks that have some
method of spamming minions.

Knife Juggler is a 2 mana minion with a 3/2 body and a very powerful effect: it does 1 damage to a random enemy when a
friendly minion is summoned. This makes it very powerful since Knife Juggler can trade 2 for 1, 3 for 1 and maybe even
higher with the right amount of luck.

It's easily one of the most threatening low-cost minions in the game (should be killed on sight).

* * *

<img src="/images/common/azure-drake.png" alt="Azure Drake" style="float: right">

#### Azure Drake

Azure Drake costs 5 mana and comes with a 4/4 body. Nothing to write home about. But it also draws a card, provides +1
spell damage and is a dragon. All of which are powerful extras.

Almost every midrange deck runs it as well as most spell-based combo decks. The Drake is a "fast" card since it draws
another card as soon as it is played and it also helps buff cheaper spells providing them the extra damage needed to
destroy tougher targets.

The 4/4 is also decent as it can trade 1 for 1 with many cards and is in a sweet spot regarding stats, since most cheap
removal can't kill it.

* * *

<img src="/images/common/defender-of-argus.png" alt="Defender of Argus" style="float: right">

#### Defender of Argus

One of the "weakest" minions in the rare category, Defender of Argus doesn't seem like a "must have" minion. However his
2/3 body comes with a powerful battlecry, since it grants both taunt and 1/1 to the minions next to the defender.

As a result Defender of Argus actually provides a total 4 damage, 5 HP and 2 taunts for 4 mana, if there are 2 targets on the
board. 2 damage also have "charge", since they can be used immediately "as part" of the minions already present on the
board.

Defender of Argus is a popular defensive option for classes which lack powerful class taunt minions. However, it is
versatile and can be seen even in aggressive decks which spam the board since the extra HP provided to the minions on
its left and right can take them out of AOE range or make trades very awkward for the enemy.
