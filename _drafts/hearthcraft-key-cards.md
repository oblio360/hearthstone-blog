title: "Hearthcraft: key cards" 
---

At the end of the [Hearthcraft Basics](http://hearthstone.oblio360.com/2015/10/26/hearthcraft-basics/) article I
mentioned that there are some key cards which should be crafted first, and I promised I'd write a separate article about
those "key cards". Well, here is that article :smile:

I will go through all the cards in Hearthstone and I will list the best cards for each category. The categories being:

<a name="toc"><a>

* [Common neutral cards](#commons-neutrals)
* [Rare neutral cards](#rare-neutrals)
* [Epic neutral cards](#epic-neutrals)
* [Legendary neutral cards](#legendary-neutrals)
* [Druid cards](#druid)
* [Hunter cards](#hunter)
* [Mage cards](#mage)
* [Paladin cards](#paladin)
* [Priest cards](#priest)
* [Rogue cards](#rogue)
* [Shaman cards](#shaman)
* [Warlock cards](#warlock)
* [Warrior cards](#warrior)
* [Tribal cards](#tribals)

### <a name="common-neutrals">Common neutral cards</a>

<img src="/images/common/piloted-shredder.png" alt="Piloted Shredder" style="float: right">

#### Piloted Shredder

The "king" of common cards in Hearthstone. Introduced in Goblins versus Gnomes, this 4 mana 4/3 minion summons a random
2 mana minion when it dies.

It is a very powerful minion because of 2 separate factors:

* it is "sticky": its removal is very awkward in most situations, requiring 2 hits, in any combination of: minion,
  weapon, direct nuke or AOE nuke
* it packs a ton of stats: under the flimsy 4/3 body (that can also trade up due to its 4 attack) the average stats of a
  2 mana minion are 2/2; as a result Shredder is basically a 4 mana 6/5 minion

Piloted Shredder can be seen in almost any kind of deck, except for the extremely aggressive ones (Face Hunter) or the
extremely greedy ones (greedy Control Warrior). But any time even those decks "move" towards midrange, they tend to
include Piloted Shredder.

* * *

<img src="/images/common/ironbeak-owl.png" alt="Ironbeak Owl" style="float: right">

#### Ironbeak Owl

Silence is a [very powerful mechanic in
Hearthstone](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/34swjq/interview_with_senior_game_designer_ben_brode_got/cqxun0c).
It's so powerful that it's literally "hidden" in the basic set (there are no silence cards that are available to a new
player when he first plays Hearthstone).

The first time a new player will use this mechanic will probably be when he gets or crafts his Ironbeak Owl.

Another staple of Hearthstone, "Hoot hoot!" as it's lovingly called by the community, is a common sight in many decks.
Aggressive decks use it to bypass taunts and to neutralize big cards with powerful effects, control decks use it to stem
the bleeding against the same aggressive decks I mentioned.

It is probably the most used "tech" card (card that's used mostly for its effect which counters a very specific, major
threat). Even if in many occasions it's only a 1-of, Ironbeak Owl sees a lot of action in Hearthstone.

The 2 mana cost 2/1 body doesn't seem much. But once it silences your <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/7749-sludge-belcher">Sludge Belcher</a> just before the <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/174-wolfrider">Wolfrider</a> and the
<a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12267-glaivezooka">Glaivezooka</a> hit you, you will see why the card is so powerful.

* * *

<img src="/images/common/leper-gnome.png" alt="Leper Gnome" style="float: right">

#### Leper Gnome

The 1 mana 2/1 body isn't impressive. But it comes with a powerful deathrattle: deal 2 damage to the enemy hero.
Leper Gnome is a staple of ultra aggressive decks. As someone called it, it is the "announcer of cancer decks" ("cancer
decks" is the not-very-sensitive name the Hearthstone community has given to decks which are extremely common and
especially very aggressive).

Leper Gnome is not flashy but it provides a guaranteed 2 damage to the enemy's face. In a well-oiled aggressive deck,
that's all you can ask from your 1 drop. Especially in the "later" turns of the game, when you need to bypass taunts.

When you hear "I feel icky!", it's time to avoid things which reduce your hero's HP, because you will miss every one of
your hit points later on.

* * *

<img src="/images/common/antique-healbot.png" alt="Antique Healbot" style="float: right">

#### Antique Healbot

A homonym for "anti-kill bot", Antique Healbot is a 5 mana 3/3 mech that heals you for 8 HP. Since he has been
introduced in the Goblins versus Gnomes expansion, Antique Healbot has been a staple of control decks.

In many control versus aggro games, the control players can be at low health levels in turn 5 or 6. This is where
Antique Healbot comes in: he heals the control player for 8, thus extending the game by 1 or 2 more turns, until the
control player can stabilize and start playing "bombs" (cards with a high mana cost and a high impact on the game).

Antique Healbot is usually played as a 1-of, or when things get really aggressive, as a 2-of.

* * *

<img src="/images/common/abusive-sergeant.png" alt="Abusive Sergeant" style="float: right">

#### Abusive Sergeant

Another flimsy 1 mana 2/1. Again, the extra text on the card makes card powerful. 

Abusive Sergeant gives a minion +2
attack the turn it is used. While it doesn't sound like much, it allows a small minion to trade with a minion which
costs 1 more mana or even 2 more mana in certain situations. It also allows a small minion to do a lot more face damage
when that's needed.

Just as his cousin, Leper Gnome, Abusive Sergeant is a staple of aggressive decks. He sometimes makes his way even into
midrange decks which need a little help with boosting their low-attack minions when they fight bigger minions.

| --------------------------- | -------------- |
| <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/338-stranglethorn-tiger">Stranglethorn Tiger</a> | Beast, sticky 5 drop used as part of the higher end of the deck for aggressive decks. |

### <a name="rare-neutrals">Rare neutral cards</a>

<img src="/images/common/knife-juggler.png" alt="Knife Juggler" style="float: right">

#### Knife Juggler

Knife Juggler, partner in aggro crime with Leper Gnome and Abusive Sergeant. If your deck is a aggro deck, there's a
huge chance that Knife Juggler is in it. Knife Juggler is so good that he's even played in midrange decks that have some
method of spamming minions.

Knife Juggler is a 2 mana minion with a 3/2 body and a very powerful effect: it does 1 damage to a random enemy when a
friendly minion is summoned. This makes it very powerful since Knife Juggler can trade 2 for 1, 3 for 1 and maybe even
higher with the right amount of luck.

It's easily one of the most threatening low-cost minions in the game (should be killed on sight).

* * *

<img src="/images/common/azure-drake.png" alt="Azure Drake" style="float: right">

#### Azure Drake

Azure Drake costs 5 mana and comes with a 4/4 body. Nothing to write home about. But it also draws a card, provides +1
spell damage and is a dragon. All of which are powerful extras.

Almost every midrange deck runs it as well as most spell-based combo decks. The Drake is a "fast" card since it draws
another card as soon as it is played and it also helps buff cheaper spells providing them the extra damage needed to
destroy tougher targets.

The 4/4 is also decent as it can trade 1 for 1 with many cards and is in a sweet spot regarding stats, since most cheap
removal can't kill it.

* * *

<img src="/images/common/defender-of-argus.png" alt="Defender of Argus" style="float: right">

#### Defender of Argus

One of the "weakest" minions in the rare category, Defender of Argus doesn't seem like a "must have" minion. However his
2/3 body comes with a powerful battlecry, since it grants both taunt and 1/1 to the minions next to the defender.

As a result Defender of Argus actually provides a total 4 damage, 5 HP and 2 taunts for 4 mana, if there are 2 targets on the
board. 2 damage also have "charge", since they can be used immediately "as part" of the minions already present on the
board.

Defender of Argus is a popular defensive option for classes which lack powerful class taunt minions. However, it is
versatile and can be seen even in aggressive decks which spam the board since the extra HP provided to the minions on
its left and right can take them out of AOE range or make trades very awkward for the enemy.

### <a name="epic-neutrals">Epic neutral cards</a>

<img src="/images/common/big-game-hunter.png" alt="Big Game Hunter" style="float: right">

#### Big Game Hunter

The bane of every "big" card in the game. If you're "taller" than 6 attack, you're in his sights.

Big Game Hunter (BGH) is one of the most popular tech cards in the game and probably the only epic card that could be
considered a "must-have".

As the opponents get stronger and stronger and the card quality goes up, Big Game Hunter becomes a common sight.

For the lowly cost of 3 mana, you get a 4/2 minion with a battlecry that instantly destroys a minion with 7 attack.
Since minions with 7 attack cost at least 4 mana, the battlecry alone covers the 3 mana paid for BGH. The minion body
left behind can then trade with another minion on the board or absorb a hateful nuke used by your opponent after he sees
that his big threat has been removed.

### Honorable mentions

| Card name                   | Why is it a good card? |
| --------------------------- | -------------- |
| <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12198-recombobulator">Recombobulator</a> | A common card in fun decks, he can "heal" damaged minions or invoke the RGN gods for even better results. |
| <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/467-doomsayer">Doomsayer</a> | Anti-aggro card, a very powerful AOE for a low cost. If he survives :smile: |
| <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/75-blood-knight">Blood Knight</a> | Tech card, used when divine shields are very, very common. |
| <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/22351-twilight-guardian">Twilight Guardian</a> | Anti-aggro card. Also a dragon, popular in dragon decks. |

| <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/264-mountain-giant">Mountain Giant</a> | Powerful minion for decks which tend to have a big hand (Handlock). |
| <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/94-molten-giant">Molten Giant</a> | Powerful minion for decks which can survive at low HP (Handlock, Echo Mage). |

### <a name="legendary-neutrals">Legendary neutral cards</a>

<img src="/images/common/dr-boom.png" alt="Doctor Boom" style="float: right">

#### Dr. Boom

The first 7 mana card in the game to be considered truly good, Dr. Boom is seen as overpowered by many.

For 7 mana he provides a 7/7 body with 2 minuscule Boom Boots besides him. Each Boom Bot is a 1/1 minion that does 1-4
damage once it is killed. That deathrattle is a very powerful effect as in the best case scenario the Boom Bots can kill
a 10 HP minion or 2x 5 HP minions. On average they're still strong, as the average damage that they do is 7.

The main minion is nothing to scoff at, as he can trade with the vast majority of minions under 9 mana.

Dr. Boom is incredibly popular and can be seen in almost any kind of deck, going from aggro to midrange/tempo to control.

* * *

<img src="/images/common/sylvanas-windrunner.png" alt="Sylvanas Windrunner" style="float: right">

#### Sylvanas Windrunner

Sylvanas is one of the most powerful 6 mana cards in the game. Besides her 5/5 body she comes with a very powerful
deathrattle, as she will steal a random enemy minion when she dies.

When she is on the board she can trade with small minions or prevent the enemy from playing his big minion, as suiciding
Sylvanas will steal it. Frequently the opposing player will have to make awkward trades to remove her or going for a
33%-50% chance that Sylvanas will steal a powerful minion, in the absence of a silence effect (<a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/500-ironbeak-owl">Ironbeak Owl</a>) or a
transform one (<a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/270-hex">Hex</a>).

Sylvanas is used successfully in many midrange and control decks.

* * *

<img src="/images/common/ragnaros-the-firelord.png" alt="Ragnaros" style="float: right;">

#### Ragnaros the Firelord

Ragnaros, the Firelord is one of the oldest legendaries in the game that is still seen in many decks and across many
meta changes.

For 8 mana you get a "turret": a 8/8 minion that cannot attack but that does 8 damage to a random target at the end of
your round. Ragnaros puts your opponent on a timer as 4 attacks from Ragnaros will kill the opponent even if he is at 30
HP.

Opponents will prioritize killing Ragnaros or, if they cannot do that, they will try to fill the board with small
minions hoping that the random attack targets them.

Ragnaros is used as a finisher for midrange/tempo decks or as a powerful minion for control decks.

* * *

<img alt="Ysera" src="/images/common/ysera.png" style="float:right;">

## Ysera

Ysera is the veteran "control dragon". She has a solid 4/12 body which is quite hard to kill unless you have direct
removal when she is played. If not answered she starts creating special cards called ["Dream
Cards"](http://hearthstone.wikia.com/wiki/Dream_Card#Dream_Cards). These cards range from decent (3 mana untargetable
3/5, 4 mana dragon 7/6) to strong (0 mana return minion to owner's hand, 0 mana give minion 5/5 then destroy it next
turn) to almost overpowered (2 mana deal 5 damage to all characters except Ysera).

Against aggro decks and midrange decks the body can trade at least 2-to-1, while the dream cards can at minimum provide
additional bodies to throw on the table and at best can provide additional reach for a surprise lethal while racing.
Aggro decks are less affected by Ysera as by turn 9, when she is usually played, they are close to killing the enemy and
Ysera doesn't have an immediate effect on the board or on either player's HP.

Besides the advantages mentioned against aggro and midrange decks, against control decks the body usually trades at
least 1-to-1 while the dream cards provide another stream of cards allowing the Ysera player to avoid drawing and going
into fatigue first.

Overall, a very solid card in slower metas and a staple of the dragon "tribe".

* * *

<img alt="Justicar Trueheart" src="/images/common/justicar-trueheart.png" style="float: right;">

## Justicar Trueheart

For 6 mana, Justicar Trueheart provides an instant effect which can be very strong. It buffs hero powers for all classes
and for some classes the effect is very powerful:

* <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/22495-tank-up">Tank Up (Warrior)</a>
* <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/22486-heal">Heal (Priest)</a>
* <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/22485-the-silver-hand">The Silver Hand (Paladin)</a>

Justicar Trueheart is great at providing extra value during long, drawn out control games or at keeping your hero alive
during the onslaught from an aggro deck.

Probably the best legendary to come out of The Great Tournament (TGT) expansion.

<img alt="Harrison Jones" src="/images/common/harrison-jones.png" style="float:right;">

* * *

## Harrison Jones

Harrison Jones is a bit of an odd-ball on the "must have" list. He's not the staple of any deck. With his 5/4 stats and
his quirky battlecry, he can't really be. He is however one of the most common "tech cards". Any time classes with
weapons flood the metagame, Harrison is bound to show up. Together with his smaller brother, <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/74-acidic-swamp-ooze">Acidic Swamp Ooze</a>. Or, for the more desperate amongst us,
<a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/453-bloodsail-corsair">Bloodsail Corsair</a>.

There are 5 classes which can have weapons:

* Rogue
* Warrior
* Hunter
* Paladin
* Shaman

It's a good bet that any time in Hearthstone's history at least one of those classes was popular of very popular. As a
result, Harrison is a common sight in decks. Even if he's not "must have" in the sense that you can't build your deck
without him, you will want to have him in those moments of need.

Against aggro and midrange decks Harrison is used either as a vanilla 5 mana 5/4 (quite underwhelming) or as a weapon
removal in a crucial moment in the game (for example against a Hunter with a <a
href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/363-eaglehorn-bow">Eaglehorn Bow</a> and a trap in play). If the midrange deck is
slower he might even be used for the second part of his battlecry, card drawing.

Against control Harrison is used in the same way, but with less emphasis on playing him without benefiting from his
battlecry, and a lot more emphasis on drawing several cards when possible.

* * *

<img alt="Alexstrasza" src="/images/common/alexstrasza.png" style="float:right;">

## Alexstrasza

Alexstrasza is another veteran from the dragon "tribe". She can be seen in control and combo decks. Depending on the
situation Alexstrasza is either used to do up to 15 damage to the enemy's face (maybe allowing lethal next turn) or to
heal for up to 15 damage. On top of the instant effect she brings a 8/8 body which trades well with most enemy minions
or forces the usage of direct removal. Even if the enemy uses removal on the body, the effect has already taken place,
and it is a very powerful effect in many circumstances.

Especially for new players Alexstrasza provides one of the best examples of "good card": instant, powerful effect on the
game.
