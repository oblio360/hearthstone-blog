title: "Hearthcraft: key cards" 
---

At the end of the [Hearthcraft Basics](http://hearthstone.oblio360.com/2015/10/26/hearthcraft-basics/) article I
mentioned that there are some key cards which should be crafted first, and I promised I'd write a separate article about
those "key cards". Well, here is that article :smile:

I will go through all the cards in Hearthstone and I will list the best cards for each category. The categories being:

<a name="toc"><a>

* [Neutral common cards](#neutral-commons)
* [Neutral rare cards](#neutral-rares)
* [Neutral epic cards](#neutral-epics)
* [Neutral legendaries](#neutral-legendaries)
* [Druid cards](#druid)
* [Hunter cards](#hunter)
* [Mage cards](#mage)
* [Paladin cards](#paladin)
* [Priest cards](#priest)
* [Rogue cards](#rogue)
* [Shaman cards](#shaman)
* [Warlock cards](#warlock)
* [Warrior cards](#warrior)
* [Tribal cards](#tribals)

#### Piloted Shredder

The "king" of common cards in Hearthstone. Introduced in Goblins versus Gnomes, this 4 mana 4/3 minion summons a random
2 mana minion when it dies.

It is a very powerful minion because of 2 separate factors:

* it is "sticky": its removal is very awkward in most situations, requiring 2 hits, in any combination of: minion,
  weapon, direct nuke or AOE nuke
* it packs a ton of stats: under the flimsy 4/3 body (that can also trade up due to its 4 attack) the average stats of a
  2 mana minion are 2/2; as a result Shredder is basically a 4 mana 6/5 minion

Piloted Shredder can be seen in almost any kind of deck, except for the extremely aggressive ones (Face Hunter) or the
extremely greedy ones (greedy Control Warrior). But any time even those decks "move" towards midrange, they tend to
include Piloted Shredder.

#### Ironbeak Owl

Silence is a [very powerful mechanic in
Hearthstone](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/34swjq/interview_with_senior_game_designer_ben_brode_got/cqxun0c).
It's so powerful that it's literally "hidden" in the basic set (there are no silence cards that are available to a new
player when he first plays Hearthstone).

The first time a new player will use this mechanic will probably be when he gets or crafts his Ironbeak Owl.

Another staple of Hearthstone, "Hoot hoot!" as it's lovingly called by the community, is a common sight in many decks.
Aggressive decks use it to bypass taunts and to neutralize big cards with powerful effects, control decks use it to stem
the bleeding against the same aggressive decks I mentioned.

The 2 mana cost 2/1 body doesn't seem much. But once it silences your <a

href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/174-wolfrider">Wolfrider</a> and the
<a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12267-glaivezooka">Glaivezooka</a> hit you, you will see why the card is so powerful.

#### Leper Gnome

The 1 mana 2/1 body isn't impressive. But it comes with a powerful deathrattle: deal 2 damage to the enemy hero.
Leper Gnome is a staple of ultra aggressive decks. As someone called it, it is the "announcer of cancer decks" ("cancer
decks" the not-very-sensitive name the Hearthstone community has given to decks which are extremely common and
especially to very aggressive decks).

Leper Gnome is not flashy but it provides a guaranteed 2 damage to the enemy's face. In a well-oiled aggressive deck,
that's all you can ask from your 1 drop. Especially in the "later" turns of the game, when you need to bypass taunts.

When you hear "I feel icky!", it's time to avoid things which reduce your hero's HP, because you will need it.
