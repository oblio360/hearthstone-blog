title: "Hearthcraft: key cards" 
---

At the end of the [Hearthcraft Basics](http://hearthstone.oblio360.com/2015/10/26/hearthcraft-basics/) article I
mentioned that there are some key cards which should be crafted first, and I promised I'd write a separate article about
those "key cards". Well, here is that article :smile:

I will go through all the cards in Hearthstone and I will list the best cards for each category. The categories being:

<a name="toc"><a>

* [Common neutral cards](#commons-neutrals)
* [Rare rare cards](#rare-neutrals)
* [Epic neutral cards](#epic-neutrals)
* [Legendary neutral cards](#legendary-neutrals)
* [Druid cards](#druid)
* [Hunter cards](#hunter)
* [Mage cards](#mage)
* [Paladin cards](#paladin)
* [Priest cards](#priest)
* [Rogue cards](#rogue)
* [Shaman cards](#shaman)
* [Warlock cards](#warlock)
* [Warrior cards](#warrior)
* [Tribal cards](#tribals)

### <a name="common-neutrals">Common neutral cards</a>

#### Piloted Shredder
<img src="/images/common/piloted-shredder.png" alt="Piloted Shredder" style="float: right">

The "king" of common cards in Hearthstone. Introduced in Goblins versus Gnomes, this 4 mana 4/3 minion summons a random
2 mana minion when it dies.

It is a very powerful minion because of 2 separate factors:

* it is "sticky": its removal is very awkward in most situations, requiring 2 hits, in any combination of: minion,
  weapon, direct nuke or AOE nuke
* it packs a ton of stats: under the flimsy 4/3 body (that can also trade up due to its 4 attack) the average stats of a
  2 mana minion are 2/2; as a result Shredder is basically a 4 mana 6/5 minion

Piloted Shredder can be seen in almost any kind of deck, except for the extremely aggressive ones (Face Hunter) or the
extremely greedy ones (greedy Control Warrior). But any time even those decks "move" towards midrange, they tend to
include Piloted Shredder.

#### Ironbeak Owl

<img src="/images/common/ironbeak-owl.png" alt="Ironbeak Owl" style="float: right">

Silence is a [very powerful mechanic in
Hearthstone](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/34swjq/interview_with_senior_game_designer_ben_brode_got/cqxun0c).
It's so powerful that it's literally "hidden" in the basic set (there are no silence cards that are available to a new
player when he first plays Hearthstone).

The first time a new player will use this mechanic will probably be when he gets or crafts his Ironbeak Owl.

Another staple of Hearthstone, "Hoot hoot!" as it's lovingly called by the community, is a common sight in many decks.
Aggressive decks use it to bypass taunts and to neutralize big cards with powerful effects, control decks use it to stem
the bleeding against the same aggressive decks I mentioned.

It is probably the most used "tech" card (card that's used mostly for its effect which counters a very specific, major
threat). Even if in many occasions it's only a 1-of, Ironbeak Owl sees a lot of action in Hearthstone.

The 2 mana cost 2/1 body doesn't seem much. But once it silences your <a

href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/174-wolfrider">Wolfrider</a> and the
<a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/12267-glaivezooka">Glaivezooka</a> hit you, you will see why the card is so powerful.

#### Leper Gnome

<img src="/images/common/leper-gnome.png" alt="Leper Gnome" style="float: right">

The 1 mana 2/1 body isn't impressive. But it comes with a powerful deathrattle: deal 2 damage to the enemy hero.
Leper Gnome is a staple of ultra aggressive decks. As someone called it, it is the "announcer of cancer decks" ("cancer
decks" is the not-very-sensitive name the Hearthstone community has given to decks which are extremely common and
especially very aggressive).

Leper Gnome is not flashy but it provides a guaranteed 2 damage to the enemy's face. In a well-oiled aggressive deck,
that's all you can ask from your 1 drop. Especially in the "later" turns of the game, when you need to bypass taunts.

When you hear "I feel icky!", it's time to avoid things which reduce your hero's HP, because you will miss every one of
your hit points later on.

#### Antique Healbot

<img src="/images/common/antique-healbot.png" alt="Antique Healbot" style="float: right">

A homonym for "anti-kill bot", Antique Healbot is a 5 mana 3/3 mech that heals you for 8 HP. Since he has been
introduced in the Goblins versus Gnomes expansion, Antique Healbot has been a staple of control decks.

In many control versus aggro games, the control players can be at low health levels in turn 5 or 6. This is where
Antique Healbot comes in: he heals the control player for 8, thus extending the game by 1 or 2 more turns, until the
control player can stabilize and start playing "bombs" (cards with a high mana cost and a high impact on the game).

Antique Healbot is usually played as a 1-of, or when things get really aggressive, as a 2-of.

* * *

#### Abusive Sergeant

<img src="/images/common/abusive-sergeant.png" alt="Abusive Sergeant" style="float: right">

Another flimsy 1 mana 2/1. Again, the extra text on the card makes card powerful. 

Abusive Sergeant gives a minion +2
attack the turn it is used. While it doesn't sound like much, it allows a small minion to trade with a minion which
costs 1 more mana or even 2 more mana in certain situations. It also allows a small minion to do a lot more face damage
when that's needed.

Just as his cousin, Leper Gnome, Abusive Sergeant is a staple of aggressive decks. He sometimes makes his way even into
midrange decks which need a little help with boosting their low-attack minions when they fight bigger minions.
